Nowadays we don’t just recommend, we encourage velvet as an added element for everyday excitement. We can’t help but think that velvet&nbsp;is the new leather.</p><p>The reason shoppers love a good pair of leather leggings? It’s an equally chic and comfortable alternative to actual leather pants and the same applies to velvet leggings. Shoppers looking to inject a layer of luxuriousness into their lives? Look no further. We’ve found <a href=# rel=noopener>the ultimate option</a> to not only nail casual, but chic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leggings-nordstrom.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel=noopener>Sweaty Betty Velvet Leggings</a> (originally $135) now only <a href=# rel=noopener>$81</a> at Nordstrom!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Sweaty Betty Velvet Leggings</a> have made a compelling case for leggings, all-day, every day. Legging lovers everywhere can rejoice because we are ruling in their favor, too.</p><p>Shoppers looking for the traditional fit and feel that the leggings we wear on rotation on the weekends are in luck! These velvet leggings keep all the benefits of our&nbsp;basic leggings but instead, take them a step further. These luxe leggings incorporate a rich and luxurious velvet material that is not only work-appropriate but night out-ready!</p><p>Still not convinced on how endlessly versatile&nbsp;velvet can be? We completely understand! We’ve gone ahead and sought out a second opinion. And who better to help convince all of Us, than a true style-icon herself.</p><p><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>&nbsp;is not only a fashion risk-taker and trendsetter but as of late, she’s also the number one fan on <a href=# rel=noopener>the velvet legging bandwagon</a>. This comes as no surprise since the&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has been a forever-fan of velvet since her Juicy Couture tracksuit days. Plus, <a href=# rel=noopener>velour tracksuits are back</a> and better than ever!</p><p>The velvet legging seems nothing short of natural and organic. Even more natural? How seamlessly KKW incorporates the latest-and-greatest piece into her wardrobe. Our favorite to date? When she paired velvet leggings with a cut-out bodysuit and strappy heels. It didn’t just look comfortable but oh-so-effortlessly, chic!</p><p>Back to <a href=# rel=noopener>these Sweaty Betty leggings</a>, though, which are available in two colors.&nbsp;The first shade is a truly stunning beetle blue which is best described as a vibrant turquoise blue. It is nothing short of captivating and endlessly amazing. Also, endlessly amazing? The second shade which is the always sleek-and-chic black. Shoppers cannot go wrong when selecting either hue, as the style options are endless.</p><p>For shoppers looking to recreate the Kardashian look, we’d perhaps recommend selecting the black shade. It can easily be recreated by adding a black, cutout bodysuit and transparent heels. Oh so chic! Even chicer? We’d recommend topping the look off <a href=# rel=noopener>with a leather jacket</a> to help transition this outfit from day-to-night. Shoppers will instantly master the art of cool dressing with this look! Bonus points? Add a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>delicate-yet-detailed crossbody</a>!</p><p>Why blend in when we were born to stand out? Shoppers will do just that in the blue option!</p><p>Who said running errands had to be boring? Instantly elevate any ensemble with these beetle blue leggings. We’d highly recommend shoppers keep the leggings as their focal point and tone down the rest of the outfit. Our suggestions? Pair them with all-white running <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>, cropped hoodie and top it off with a leather jacket<a href=# rel=noopener> or puffer jacket</a>!&nbsp;Talk about the ultimate girl-on-the-go outfit!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/legging.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel=noopener>Sweaty Betty Velvet Leggings</a> (originally $135) now only <a href=# rel=noopener>$81</a> at Nordstrom!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Looking for more of a lazy-yet-luxurious outfit? We highly recommend pairing these oh-so-stylish leggings with an oversized sweater. It will instantly add balance to the look. The only thing better than the added balance? Added comfort! We can’t think of anything more <a href=# rel=noopener>comfortable than these UGG slippers</a>&nbsp;and we’re gushing over how endlessly chic-yet-comfortable this outfit would be. Not only will this look cure any Sunday scaries, but it would also be totally work-appropriate by <a href=# rel=noopener>mixing in a classic, chic tote.</a> Talk about a real, two-for-one!</p><p>The only thing more endlessly versatile than velvet? The endless reviews in favor of the versatile velvet leggings! Reviewers cannot help rave about these trendy and transitional leggings that have become a staple in all shopper’s weekly wardrobes. One reviewer claims how amazingly beautiful the shade is saying they are the ultimate lounge-to-gym-t0-lunch pants. Talk about a triple threat!</p><p>Even more amazing? Reviewers cannot get over just how truly stunning and beautiful the shades are in real life. These leggings are not only comfortable but fashion-forward, how fabulous! Other reviewers similarly echo how these classy and chic these leggings are for a little luxury at yoga. We can’t help but agree!</p><p>The long list of reasons why shoppers need these luxurious leggings are endless, as are the reviews. Shoppers shouldn’t just take our word, but the reviewers, and opt for <a href=# rel=noopener>these exceptionally flattering leggings</a>!</p><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel=noopener>Sweaty Betty Velvet Leggings</a> (originally $135) now only <a href=# rel=noopener>$81</a> at Nordstrom!
