On another note, the closeness of the token teenagers&nbsp;attending a fictionalized version of Beverly Hills High could be seen as a metaphor for the behind-the-scenes happenings on set of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-scenes antics</a> of Beverly Hills 90210 could be seen in a similar dramatic fashion to the storylines being written for the show's scripts. Shannen Doherty, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">played the show's first 'bad girl</a>,' almost became more known in the public eye for her reputation behind the camera than her on-screen performance. Doherty's castmate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Austin Green</a>, who portrayed signature good-guy David Silver, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiffani Thiessen</a>, who joined the cast during the series' fifth season as Doherty's replacement after she was let go from the cast, know this idea to be true!</p><p>Unbeknownst to some of the crew, Brian Austin Green and Tiffani Thiessen had begun dating off-camera. Bringing Thiessen into his fictional world often ruled by love triangles and the effortless ability of some characters to tell a lie without a second thought, wasn't the easiest transition for Green. He was not very keen on the idea of his real-life flame getting intimate with her co-stars; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Charles Rosin</a>, the man responsible for being the series' executive producer, watching Thiessen on-screen was "Very hard for Brian. It was pretty clear given how he was reacting to Tiffani experimenting with her acting, as much as anything with her roles and herself being young, that it was unlikely they could stay together as a couple."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=romance-geeting-reel>Romance Geeting 'Reel'</h2><p>The idea of Tiffani Thiessen having any involvement in Beverly Hills 90210&nbsp;could be seen as a cosmic connection, to some! The Saved By The Bell actress was already getting cozy with Brian Austin Green behind-the-scenes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and according to Brian, himself</a>, the pair were already dating by the time she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cast on the series</a> in 1994. Perhaps channeling some of his character's signature sense of confidence, Green was the first to make a move, asking her on a date back in 1992.</p><p>Green was quite the heartthrob off-screen in comparison to his Beverly Hills 90210 alter ego, who had eyes for one girl for the majority of the series; He admitted to being quite the ladies man behind the scenes! His relationship with Thiessen blossomed after their first date, with the pair going on to date one another until 1995. Their relationship overlapped with Thiessen's aforementioned&nbsp;casting on the series, an idea which did not sit as well with her boyfriend as his sense of confidence might lead us to believe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having his personal and professional lives collide lead Green to call Rosin and fellow producer Larry Mollin upon finding out his girlfriend was cast on the show, leading the producers to feel caught off guard, according to Rosin. Rosin had some tough love for the young actor, advising him to consult Beverly Hills 90210's creator Aaron Spelling if he had problems with his girlfriend's presence, before adding "It was Aaron's cast, [and] we were very happy with the decision!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Aaron Spelling's Net Worth Was When He Died</a></span></p><h2 id=locking-lips-and-on-screen-sparks>Locking Lips And On-Screen Sparks</h2><p>Tiffani, herself, felt a bit hesitant when it came to stepping into the already well-established cast. Many years later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she revealed to Meredith Vieira</a> she had initially felt reluctant to the idea of becoming co-workers with her boyfriend, but the enormous popularity of the show kept Thiessen from getting cold feet and backing out of the project. She smiled when recalling, "I was getting a job on Beverly Hills 90210, I wasn't going to say 'no' to that!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Enter a man with the potential to strike fear into boyfriends everywhere back in Beverly Hills 90210's heyday; The late Luke Perry, who played the show's signature heartthrob Dylan McKay, stole the hearts of many Nineties teens, and made an impression with the ladies of the show, on-screen and off! Several of the female cast members had the opportunity to lock lips with Perry through the years, and Thiessen was no exception! Dylan McKay was the first guy to kiss Thiessen's character Valerie Malone, much to Brian Austin Green's chagrin, off-screen!</p><p>Thiessen went on to reveal she believed the "More awkward" element to her being cast on the show alongside her boyfriend, was due to the fact she had been directed to have her first on-screen kiss with Perry. She jokingly added in reference to&nbsp;her work&nbsp;environment with Green,&nbsp; "Literally having your boyfriend on the show and then kissing another man. I'm getting paid for this! I don't know what to tell you!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics That Make Us Miss Luke Perry</a></span></p><h2 id=a-match-not-made-in-television-heaven>A Match Not Made In Television Heaven</h2><p>Hindsight can be a great tool for some to make sense of ourselves. For Green, whose romance with Thiessen did not last and lead to a 1995 break-up, his version of events surrounding their relationship could perhaps serve as an explanation to the insecurities of his younger days. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">openly admitted to Us Weekly</a> many years later he "Did not deal with rejection very well."</p><p>Fortunately for the&nbsp;endearing concept of longtime friendship, the former couple were able to put aside their differences and remain close. Thiessen only has good memories of her years spent dating Green. She revealed the duo "Made it work," before adding they were "Sill close and very good friends," a far cry from the often-drama laden pages of a Beverly Hills, 90210 script!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did The Cast Of 'Beverly Hills, 90210' Get Paid A Lot For The Reboot?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirop6WlruqecCmmZ6qXam1qrHSrJynZWllf3J8jKucpZmknryvv8eip2avmam1bq7RopinZZGqwLW1zWaeq52Vo3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-vincent-vinny-alia-from-next-level-chef-season-2-575734-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Vincent Vinny Alia From Next Level Chef Season 2?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-lambert-wears-t-shirt-with-boyfriend-anderson-easts-name-w433126.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Lambert Wears T-Shirt With Boyfriend Anderson Easts Name</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
