We're talking about none other than Taylor Swift. Stern brought up the fact that Emily Blunt is a Swiftie. In addition, Stern asked Blunt if she ever met Swift in person, and how she feels about the artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As expected, Blunt spoke glowingly about Swift, and what their encounter was like. Blunt said she'll never forget the way Swift made her daughter feel.</p><p>She tells Howard Stern, "She's the nicest. She was so nice to my kids. My oldest kid had just cut all of her hair off, that she was very self-conscious about. And Taylor Swift goes, 'God look at you, this '60s beatnick cool kid, I just love your style.' I just though my child was going to faint. It was the best thing anyone has ever done for my child."</p><p><strong>Stern concludes, "That's so sweet that she did that. Isn't it nice when someone is nice to your kid." Blunt continues, "It changes everything. It makes me melt."</strong></p><p>Stern then joked that Blunt needs to be careful that her kids don't get a big head, getting complimented by Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-28t170020-931.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Even David Letterman Was Taken Aback By Taylor Swift's Ability To Speak Japanese During Their Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Letterman and fans did not expect Taylor Swift to speak in Japanese years ago during their Late Show interview.</span><p>A great interview moment, but we've seen similar occurrences with other celebs in the past, glowing about their experience with Taylor Swift.</p><h2 id=other-celebs-shared-similar-stories-to-emily-blunt-39-s-experience-with-taylor-swift>Other Celebs Shared Similar Stories To Emily Blunt's Experience With Taylor Swift</h2><p>We can add Stephen Colbert to the list of celebs that are <a href=#>forever a Taylor Swift fan</a> following a moment between the artist and his daughter. Similar to Blunt, Colbert could not believe the treatment his daughter got from the artist, who was once again full of praise towards her.</p><p>“I’ll love Taylor Swift ’til the day I die,” he began. “I would put on armor and follow her into battle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-the-artist-s-interaction-with-his-daughter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Colbert continues, “She turns around and goes, ‘Pretty girl!’ and comes and puts her arms around her and goes, ‘Oh you look amazing!'” he recalled. “She just praises my daughter for how she looks for, like, 30 seconds. I would jump off a cliff into a pit of spikes for that woman for how nice she was to my daughter,” he added. “You’ve got to remember that!”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/joe-alwyn-gq-men-of-the-year-awards.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Joe Alwyn Spending More Time In NYC After News He's Dating Again Since Taylor Swift Breakup</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After announcing he was dating again, Joe Alwyn is reportedly splitting his time between London and New York.</span><p>David Harbour shared a similar story of his stepdaughter's experience with Swift.</p><p>"A woman came out with a letter and it was addressed to me and my stepdaughter. It was a handwritten letter on a particular stationary," Harbour said. "I've never seen my stepdaughter speechless. She did say in the letter at one point, 'I'll give you a wave from the stage.' And at one point during the beginning of one of her numbers she turned to our little booth and [waved]."</p><p>What made the moment that much better was the fact that Harbour wasn't even told about the gesture prior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alanis-morissette-also-spoke-fondly-to-howard-stern-of-her-experience-with-taylor-swift>Alanis Morissette Also Spoke Fondly To Howard Stern Of Her Experience With Taylor Swift</h2><p>Howard Stern also brought up Taylor Swift during his interview alongside Alanis Morissette back in 2015. The artist was asked about working with Swift. Alanis Morissette admitted to Stern that <a href=#>her experience with Taylor Swift was the opposite of what she expected.</a></p><p>Alanis grew to fame in the industry during a time in which female duets were basically forbidden. That clearly changed thanks to artists like Taylor Swift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-04t154154-287.png><p>Morissette tells Stern, "It was the total opposite of my experience in my 20s. There wasn't a lot of sisterhood. I'd do these rock shows with like 500 men, and line one woman."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stern adds, "It makes sense. She's always singing about guys f****** over. And here you were writing it around her age, about guys f****** you over. You guys have something really in common, you know how to capitalize on that."</p><p>Morissette concluded that Swift is "built for this." Almost a decade since the interview, that statement still holds true, as Swift is the face of the music industry at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqGcrnqjuNSnq2agn6yus7CMrKueqp5iuqax06KloGWklsatu9FmqrChlql8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./graham-larson-rhea-seehorn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Graham Larson Wikipedia: Rhea Seehorns Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bam Margera News - Us Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
