From navigating through a series of unsuccessful relationships to grappling with an undisclosed mental health journey. Now, once again, the pop icon of <a href=#><strong>music</strong> </a>finds herself entangled in another challenging legal battle. This comes in the wake of her recent split from her husband, Sam Asghari.</p><p>As per the BBC's report, Asghari submitted a divorce petition stating "irreconcilable differences" between him and Spears. However, some sources suggest a different narrative, asserting that Asghari might have used alleged tactics to renegotiate their prenuptial agreement, even hinting at possible blackmail involving Spears. Nevertheless, it seems that the pop star isn't backing down in this situation. Reports indicate that she has enlisted a formidable team of lawyers, determined not to yield to any purported demands from Asghari.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-get-divorced>Why Did Britney Spears And Sam Asghari Get Divorced?</h2><p>Sam Asghari used to be a strong advocate for the end of Britney Spears' conservatorship, but now <a href=#>fans are convinced that he only used Spears as he filed for divorce after only a year of marriage</a>. According to Entertainment Tonight, Spears occasionally found herself in disagreements, all the while sensing that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asghari was placing constraints on her freedom.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/britney-spears-banned-most-of-her-family-from-her-wedding-to-sam-asghari-and-those-who-were-invited-didn-t-even-show-up.jpg><p>Another source disclosed to ET, "Britney felt like things shifted in her relationship with Sam once her conservatorship ended. Before it ended, Britney was more in a set routine, but once she was free, a lot changed. Britney wanted to embrace her freedom and felt like Sam couldn't necessarily handle that. Britney will never let another person control her, and she felt like that was starting to happen again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the pop star's legal battle with her father, Jamie Spears, to terminate her conservatorship, another insider informed ET that Asghari believes that Jamie Spears' excessive control creates complications in his relationship with the singer.</p><p>The "Circus" singer's conservatorship was officially dissolved on November 12, 2021. Subsequently, Spears and Asghari exchanged vows on June 9, 2022. Just a bit over a year later, Asghari filed for divorce in August 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kevin Federline Speaks Out Amid Britney Spears And Sam Asghari Divorce</a></span></p><p>In an Instagram statement, the actor shared, "After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.

Although Asghari initiated the divorce filing, the court documents reveal his request for Spears to cover his legal expenses and provide spousal support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the couple's prenuptial agreement prevents Asghari from receiving any form of support from Spears, including spousal assistance. According to sources cited by Page Six, it is said that Asghari had purportedly initiated efforts to modify the provisions and sought more than what their existing prenuptial arrangement stipulates.</p><p>He had previously consented to a prenup that favored Spears, but now, in an attempt to persuade her into a revised agreement, Asghari has reportedly resorted to threatening the release of "embarrassing information" about her. However, the pop star appears to be standing her ground. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spears reportedly enlisted a formidable team of legal experts</a>, indicative of her resolve not to acquiesce to the supposed demands of Asghari.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Of Britney Spears' Net Worth Is Spent On Her Doberman Porsha's Lavish Lifestyle?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, Asghari's representatives have countered these claims. Denying any pursuit of a prenup challenge or intent to exploit Spears, "There are many claims that Sam is challenging the prenup and threatening to exploit his ex-wife with videos. However, all these claims are false. No negative intention has ever been directed towards her and never will be," they stated. "Sam has always and will always support her."</p><h2 id=britney-spears-denied-the-cheating-allegations-that-played-a-role-in-her-divorce-from-sam-asghari>Britney Spears Denied The Cheating Allegations That Played A Role In Her Divorce From Sam Asghari</h2><p>On August 16, 2022, Sam Asghari filed divorce documents against Britney Spears. Coincidentally, TMZ had just revealed their split on the same day, accompanied by allegations that a heated confrontation ensued between the former couple. This confrontation was apparently due to rumors of Spears' alleged infidelity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Britney-Spears-Wants-A-Family-With--Sam-Asghari-Calls-Him-My-Husband.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Britney and Sam have split.

"She has been denying any cheating allegations and going through a lot of emotions. She is hurt because the situation brings up old feelings for her. This is the last thing she needed, especially after her boys moved to Hawaii, being worried about the fires there, and so on."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/is-britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-s-relationship-as-perfect-as-it-seems_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source also added that Spears has been making efforts to regain her emotional, physical, and mental well-being, with a supportive circle rallying around her. The speculated disagreements between Spears and Asghari have been a consistent aspect of their relationship. While their mutual affection is apparent, they frequently engage in arguments over essential matters, sometimes feeling that their needs aren't fully understood. This situation recently escalated, resulting in more intense and genuine disputes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pop star has addressed the public following the announcement of her separation from her husband. She expressed that she "couldn't endure the pain any longer" and revealed that she was a bit surprised about the conclusion of her six-year relationship with Asghari.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What We Know About The Possible Involvement Of Britney Spears' Ex Manager In Angus Cloud's Tragic Death</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spears discussed their breakup in an Instagram post, stating, "I'm not here to explain why because it's honestly nobody's business.
