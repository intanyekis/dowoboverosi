Perry claimed that Diaz got “immediately stoned” during a group dinner party and “wasn’t interested in him at all." Cameron Diaz had been dating Timberlake between 2003 and 2007 before a very public split.</p><p>"But the party went on nevertheless, and at one point we were all playing a game — Pictionary, I think," Perry explained. "As she was drawing, I said something witty to Cameron, to which she said, 'Oh, come on!' and proceeded to punch me in the shoulder."</p><p>But the actress missed and actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">smacked the 17 Again actor in the face</a>. Perry explained that he was caught off guard and shocked by Diaz accidentally punching him. "'Are you f****** kidding me?' I said, realizing I'd just been punched in the face by Cameron Diaz, and my big arms hadn't helped at all," he recalled. The star previously explained he began working out around this era, and wore his sleeves rolled up to show off his muscles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron Diaz and Matthew Perry's relationship didn't go any further than this incident, and there wasn't a second date.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Former Friends Guest Star Admitted He Had A Hard Time Reading Matthew Perry's Memoir</a></span></p><h2 id=what-matthew-perry-39-s-relationship-with-julia-roberts-was-like>What Matthew Perry's Relationship With Julia Roberts Was Like</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-julia-roberts-forgive-matthew-perry-before-he-died_.jpg><p>In addition to sharing details about his "romantic" interaction with Cameron Diaz, Matthew Perry also opened up in his memoir about his romance with Julia Roberts.

He revealed that he would find himself at a "party sharing a flirtatious exchange with an attractive woman and cut the conversation short, so I could race home and see if a new fax had arrived. Nine times out of 10, one had.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Matthew Perry And Aisha Tyler On The Set Of Friends?</a></span></p><p>Perry added that the Erin Brockovich star's messages were “so smart” and he felt as if “she was placed on this planet to make the world smile”.</p><p>“The way she strung sentences together, the way she saw the world, the way she articulated her unique thoughts, all was so captivating,” he added, revealing their first phone call together lasted for five hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he broke up with Julia Roberts</a> because dating the Oscar winner was "too much for him," and he was sure she would end the relationship. “So instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts.”</p><h2 id=more-of-matthew-perry-39-s-famous-past-relationships>More Of Matthew Perry's Famous Past Relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-one-friends-question-matthew-perry-told-an-interviewer-to-stop-asking-during-their-candid-conversation-1.jpg><p>Cameron Diaz and Julia Roberts were not the only<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> famous women Matthew Perry has been connected to</a>.
