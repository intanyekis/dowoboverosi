Lawton told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> in 2015. “It gave Hollywood permission to do it, and then [director] <a href=#>Garry [Marshall]</a> was smart enough, because he’s got incredible pop instincts, to say, ‘OK, this is what people want to see — they want to see the fairy tale.'”</p><p><strong><a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> </strong>and<a href=#><strong> Richard Gere</strong> </a>starred in the movie, which was released on March 23, 1990, but several other actors were up for the parts of Vivian and Edward, including <a href=#><strong>Michelle Pfeiffer</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Al Pacino.</strong></a></p><p>“They had auditioned Al Pacino, they had auditioned Michelle Pfeiffer, and it would definitely have been a different movie if had it been Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer,” Lawton explained. “It might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending. But the chemistry between Julia and Gere, it is palpable on the screen, it was palpable in auditions. You can’t really see how it could end any other way, because they just light up with each other.”</p><p>The film ultimately followed Edward, a wealthy businessman, hiring (and subsequently falling for) Vivian, a prostitute.</p><p>Director Marshall, for his part, wanted to be sure the film kept some edge, but told a love story.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My vision was a combination of fairytales. Julia was Rapunzel, Richard was Prince Charming and <strong>Hector [Elizondo]</strong> was the fairy godmother,” Marshall told VF. “It didn’t seem like a vision everybody would have, but I did.”</p><p>Scroll through for fun facts about the film:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19mfW6y1Kdkn5mTqcBuss6rZKmqlanBunnWqKSapqNigHHAx2aYp6aZq7Kzv8CrsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-mike.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr Mike</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kyrie-irving-pushes-back-antisemitic-labels-promoting-movie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kyrie Irving Pushes Back on Antisemitic Labels After Promoting Movie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
