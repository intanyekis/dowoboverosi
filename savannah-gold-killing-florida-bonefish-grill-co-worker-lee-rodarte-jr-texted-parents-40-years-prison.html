The 30-year-old, Lee Rodarte Jr, admitted to killing 21-year-old Savannah Gold in 2017 as he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges last month. Rodarte, who was a manager at a Bonefish Grill in Jacksonville, had engaged in an on-and-off relationship with Gold, who also worked at the restaurant, People reported.</p><p>Prosecutors negotiated with Rodarte's defense and agreed on a sentence of 40 years with credit for time served. The plea deal was approved by a judge last Thursday afternoon, March 11, per the outlet.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Sarm Heslop?

Inside horrific incest, murder, and 'worst tenant' tales</a></p><p>In August 2017, Gold reportedly went missing after having arrived at work but never making it into the building. Authorities located her car in the parking lot of the premises and noticed that a tire was slashed and her purse was on the front seat of the vehicle.</p><p>Surveillance footage from the parking lot was obtained by the Jacksonville sheriff, who said in a press release at the time that Gold had arrived at work that day at around 5.30 pm. Moments later, she entered Rodarte's vehicle and, "at 5:45 p.m., the video surveillance shows what appears to be a possible struggle inside of the vehicle."</p><p>According to the sheriff, Rodarte was "observed walking to the victim's vehicle" after the apparent altercation, "opening the drivers-side door of the vehicle, and leaning inside." Just minutes later, Rodarte drove away with Gold still in his vehicle.</p><p>Authorities noted how Gold's family began receiving odd text messages sent from her phone within hours of her disappearance. "Hey I just wanted to tell you and mom I met a really great guy and we're running away together," read one text sent to her father, Daniel Gold, per a missing person's report. "I love him and we're leaving tonight I'll call you later when we get to where we are going."</p><p>Some other family members and close pals also reported receiving similar messages, thereby raising suspicion immediately. "The spelling was all whacked out," Daniel Gold&nbsp;told local TV station WJAX. "It looked really strange."</p><p>The text messages began after Gold was dead, and detectives believe it was Rodarte who sent them using her phone. According to People, Rodarte helped Gold's family in their search efforts and even handed out "missing person" flyers for them.</p><p>When he was interrogated days after the disappearance, Rodarte changed his story multiple times and eventually confessed to authorities. He said he killed Gold in the parking lot before disposing of her body in a nearby lake. Her remains were later recovered by a dive team.</p><p>The Gold family is finally beginning to heal from the tragedy, now that Rodarte is behind bars. "To our family, extended family, and community, our hearts have begun to heal because of your love and support," Daniel Gold said in a statement to Action News Jacksonville after the sentencing. "We love Savannah, and we never realized how many of you did also."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5Grrq%2B6wKFkoKecmXqstculoKefXZu5sL7InZhmmp%2Bjsqe10qFkoKqZoblur85mrqiqm5q%2FbrjEnmSrp5SWv7WxjKOpZqyVrcGmsIypmKudnqnAboCPZrCemaKoerG%2ByKympw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wwes-becky-lynch-gives-birth-to-1st-child-with-fiance-seth-rollins.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWEs Becky Lynch Gives Birth to 1st Child With Fiance Seth Rollins</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mohamed-bamba-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mohamed Bamba | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
