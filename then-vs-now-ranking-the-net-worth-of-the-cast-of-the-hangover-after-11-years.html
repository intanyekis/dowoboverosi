Released in 2009, the film centered around a Bachelor party where three Best Men wake up the following day with a Hangover having no recollection of the night before or their shenanigans. <a href=#>Directed by Todd Phillips</a>, the movie achieved a significant milestone when an R-rated comedy became one of the most successful movies of that year. With a $35 million budget, the first movie made $469.3 million at the box office worldwide, and <a href=#>collectively the movies have earned</a> over a billion dollars via three installments.</p><p>By releasing blockbuster movies, The Hangover gave a spotlight to its lead cast, and they received worldwide recognition. From the supporting cast to the lead actors from The Hangover, let’s take a look at the net worth ranking of the talented cast 11 years later.</p><h2 id=mike-tyson>Mike Tyson</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of The Hangover Part I and Part II highlights was seeing Mike Tyson. While the former heavyweight boxer had initially refused the offer to star in the movie, he changed his mind after discovering that it was to be directed by Todd Phillips, a director he admired. During his heyday, <a href=#>Tyson was one of the highest-paid athletes</a> with over $300 million net worth; however, his excessive spending lowered it to only $10 million, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Top 10 Greatest Mike Tyson Knockouts</a></span></p><h2 id=ken-jeong>Ken Jeong</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A character that showed up out of nowhere, Ken Jeong’s hilarious depiction as the Chinese gangster Mr. Chow was loved by all. After his supporting role in the movie, Ken came into spotlight and was paid $5 million to star in the third part of the installment. As Jeong was a stand-up comedian until 2007, his net worth was relatively low, and today, he has amassed a $14 million fortune.</p><h2 id=jeffrey-tambor>Jeffrey Tambor</h2><p>Playing the bride's father, Jeffrey Tambor had some of the most iconic lines in the movie. Tambor is well known on the television screen for starring in shows such as Golden Girls, The Larry Sanders Show, and most notably Arrested Development. The show originally ran between 2003-2006 and was revived in 2013, where he made $125,000 per episode, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The actor’s current net worth is $16 million.</p><h2 id=justin-bartha>Justin Bartha</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justin Bartha played the character of Doug, the groom that goes missing in The Hangover and causes the Best Men to recall their wild night. Bartha was already well-versed with acting in big franchises as he had a supporting role <a href=#>in Nicolas Cage’s</a> popular National Treasure series. The actor has earned a $16 million net worth from his movies, and the majority came from his salary in The Hangover series.</p><h2 id=heather-graham>Heather Graham</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heather Graham had known the world of acting since the age of 12 when she began starring in commercials and taking small parts in movies. Before playing a stripper/escort in The Hangover, her most notable role was Boogie Nights, which made her a household name. She has starred in memorable music videos, television shows, and movies over the years. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, she currently has a $20 million net worth due to her acting credits.</p><h2 id=ed-helms>Ed Helms</h2><p>One of the movie's lead actors, Ed Helms, plays the role of a dentist Stuart Price. Being already popular due to his supporting role in the hit NBC sitcom The Office, Helms was already getting paid upwards of $20,000 during the show's initial seasons when he starred in the movie. While he was paid $1 million for his role in the first movie, the actor made $5 million for the second installment. He received a whopping $15 million-plus backend royalties for his portrayal for the third installment, raising his net worth to $25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zach-galifianakis>Zach Galifianakis</h2><p>One of the most loved characters in the movie and the <a href=#>role that showed off Zach Galifianakis</a>’ perfect comedy timing, Galifianakis portrayed the role of the brother of the bride Alan who had ADHD. While the movie was in production, the actor had also begun his Emmy-winning show Between Two Ferns, earning critical and commercial success. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, similar to Helms, he earned $1 million, $5 million, and $15 million, respectively, for each installment and has a $40 million net worth.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper>Bradley Cooper</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hangover franchise gave <a href=#>the biggest movie star to the world, Bradley Cooper</a>. Showing off his comedic timing as Phil, the Groom's best friend, Cooper became a popular choice to play leading men in drama and comedy movies. He starred in hit movies such as The Silver Linings Playbook, American Sniper, and Joy. His breakthrough role as a Director and Actor came in A Star Is Born, where he made $39.9 million in backend royalties along with his $21 million earnings from The Hangover. Through his prolific filmography and earnings through box office sales of his movies, Cooper has earned a whopping $100 million net worth to date.</p><p>While there may not be a possibility of a fourth installment to The Hangover franchise, the movies have shone a spotlight on some of the most talented actors. They have had successful careers in film and television. Eleven years later, the movies still remain classic, and people reminisce about the time by watching the series on Netflix.</p><p>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Bond Magic: 10 Highest Grossing James Bond Films At The Box Office, Ranked</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbHNZq2sZZ6kxG6%2BwKeioqaXYsGpsYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMqJ1mrJiaeqSt0q1kqJ5dqbWmeceapaCnppq%2Fbq3FrZyrZWFmerqxwKuqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio-goes-topless-while-tanning-revealing-picture-2014277.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alessandra Ambrosio Goes Topless While Tanning: Revealing Picture</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-bloomberg-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Bloomberg Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
