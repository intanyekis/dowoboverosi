The singer is in love with his partner, and they remind him of home and the warmth of church choirs singing among the trees. He loves her like the mountains, in the way that they welcome the morning. He is grateful for her presence and wishes to express it more often. He confesses that he acts angry most of the time and hides his emotions. However, he promises that if she stays, he would let go of his bottled-up anger and express his love every day. He asks her to stay and shake the frost off his bones.</p><br><p>The song's lyrics poetically symbolize the struggles of love and the importance of communication. The singer recognizes his love's impact on him, but he also acknowledges his flaws and the need to change them. He mentions Mustang as a symbol of his high hopes, but the price of the dreams became too high that he ended up giving up. It could symbolize his fear of expressing his feelings due to past experiences. However, he is willing to let go of that fear for the sake of his love's happiness. The song's overall message can be summarized that love requires sacrifices and vulnerability to thrive.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>You remind me of a Sunday</u><br>Your presence fills me with warmth and comfort, like the feeling of a peaceful Sunday at home.</p><br><p><u>Back home in old Kentucky</u><br>My mind goes to my hometown in Kentucky, where everything feels familiar and comforting.</p><br><p><u>With the church choirs just beltin' to the pines</u><br>I can hear the sound of the church choir singing their hearts out in the midst of tall pine trees.</p><br><p><u>And I love you like the mountains</u><br>My love for you is as strong and unmovable as the mountains themselves.</p><br><p><u>Love the way you the mornin opens</u><br>I adore the way you greet each day with positivity and brightness.</p><br><p><u>To a soft and bright greetin from the sun</u><br>You embrace the start of each day with a warm and welcoming attitude, just like the sun.</p><br><p><u>So if it'd make you stay</u><br>If making you stay with me means anything to you, I would do anything to make that happen.</p><br><p><u>I wouldn't act so angry all the time</u><br>I promise to let go of my anger that I often hold on to.</p><br><p><u>I wouldn't keep it all inside</u><br>I promise to express my love and emotions instead of bottling them up inside.</p><br><p><u>and id let you know how much I love you each and every day</u><br>I vow to tell you every day how much I love and appreciate you.</p><br><p><u>So darlin stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones</u><br>Please stay right by my side and help melt away the cold, lonely feeling in my bones.</p><br><p><u>Well I used to ride a mustang</u><br>I used to feel free and unstoppable, like when riding a mustang.</p><br><p><u>And id run that thing on high hopes</u><br>I had the confidence and optimism to pursue my dreams with everything I had.</p><br><p><u>Till they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay</u><br>The cost and obstacles to achieving my dreams eventually became too much to bear.</p><br><p><u>So I let that car just sit there when I should've took you drivin</u><br>I regret not taking more chances in life and spending more quality time with you, instead leaving that car idle.</p><br><p><u>With the windows down while the music played</u><br>I missed out on opportunities to have fun and make memories with you, cruising with the windows down to our favorite tunes.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Josiah B.
