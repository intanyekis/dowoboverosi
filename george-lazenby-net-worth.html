His father was a railway worker and his mother worked at a department store. Lazenby attended Goulburn Public School and then Goulburn High School until 1954. His family then moved to Queanbeyan for his father’s work. He had one sister, Barbara, who became an accomplished dancer.</p><h2><span id=George_Lazenbys_Career_and_Films>George Lazenby’s Career and Films</span></h2><p>George Lazenby initially joined the Australian Army and later became a used car salesman and mechanic in London. He was spotted by a talent scout and became well-known for appearing in an advertisement for Fry’s chocolate bar, which led to him being cast as James Bond in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” However, he decided not to reprise the role despite many people telling him he should continue making the Bond movies.</p><p>After leaving the Bond franchise, Lazenby made his next film in 1971, “Universal Soldier,” which he helped write. He then appeared in “Who Saw Her Die?” and “Play For Today” on the BBC. He made three films for Golden Harvest from 1974 to 1976 and returned to Australia to act in commercials and television films.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Lazenby moved to Hollywood to reactivate his career and landed roles in projects like “Hawaii 5-0,” “Evening in Byzantium,” and “Superboy.” He appeared in a number of television projects and made-for-television movies throughout the early 1990s. He also lent his voice to a 2019 audiobook project, “Passport to Oblivion.”</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>George Lazenby married Chrissie Townson in 1973 and they had two children. Their daughter, Melanie, became a real estate broker in New York, while their son Zachary passed away at the age of 19 after developing a malignant brain tumor at 11. Lazenby and Townson later divorced.</p><p>In 2002, Lazenby married former tennis pro Pam Shriver and they had three children, including twins born in 2005. They filed for divorce after six years of marriage. Lazenby currently resides in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and has been referenced in popular culture due to his one-time appearance as James Bond.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCzxKipoJ1doa67sc2bsGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jenna-bush-hager-wiki-husband-children-net-worth-age-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Bush Hager Wiki, Husband, Children, Net worth, Age, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eduard-von-capelle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eduard von Capelle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
