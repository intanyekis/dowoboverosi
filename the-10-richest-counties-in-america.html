However, it is also renowned for its huge economic inequalities that are a regular topic of debate, with wealth concentrated in certain elite and exclusive districts. Are the richest counties concentrated, or are they equally spread out across the continent?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The United States is made up of 3, 144 counties and county-equivalents. The most affluent of these follow no general rule - some suburban, others urban, and many nature havens. However, most are located near - although not&nbsp;too&nbsp;near - big cities, allowing for commuters to get the best of both worlds: work in the city, and come home to a quieter neighbouring county. Therefore, a county's connectedness to bigger urban centres is a key factor in its economic landscape.</p><p>The following list has been drawn up according to 2012 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It ranks the top ten wealthiest American counties&nbsp;with populations of 65, 000 or more. Each county's wealth is determined according to the average household income in the area. Some interesting trends emerge through this data; though Virginia ranks only seventh wealthiest of the fifty US states, many of the country's richest counties are concentrated within its boundaries. New Jersey is the 3rd richest US state, and comes a close second in term of its concentration of wealthy counties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-morris-county-new-jersey---95-294><strong>10.

The county is elevated, in relief from east to west.&nbsp;The county's highest point is at 1,395 feet above sea level.&nbsp;Only the eastern suburbs in the Passaic River&nbsp;valley are relatively level and more developed. Indeed, the great outdoors are a high priority here, with 13, 000 acres set aside for 28 county parks. These are rich in rivers, lakes and nature reserves and also include numerous golf courses.&nbsp;The major employer of the county is&nbsp;Novartis Life Sciences, providing jobs for&nbsp;over 5, 000 of the&nbsp;&nbsp;492,276 population. The major industries that drive Morris county's economy are finance, insurance, real estate, pharmaceuticals, health services, research and development, and technology.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-douglas-county-colorado---95-324><strong>9.

Somerset County, New Jersey - $95, 825&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Somerset County, located in New Jersey, is known for its natural beauty. The unspoiled nature is an ideal city getaway.

Putnam is made up of six towns and three incorporated villages.

In 2011 Hunterdon also had the highest tax rate in the US with an average of $8, 216.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-fairfax-county-virginia---107-096><strong>3.

However, the government is the largest employer at&nbsp;Fort Belvoir, the county's single biggest location of federal employment.

Affluence seems synonymous with health in Fairfax, where&nbsp;males have a&nbsp;life expectancy of 81.1 years - the highest in the nation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-howard-county-maryland---108-844><strong>2.

Loudoun County, Virginia - $117, 876&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Loudoun County is the third most populated county in Virginia, and also its richest. Traditionally a rural wheat-producing county, Loudoun's population has soared since the 1980s: today its population has reached 312, 311. Currently, it has a population density of approximately 606 people per square mile. This is explained by the development of a fully-fledged service economy in the area since the 1990s, and the suburbanisation of the county. Loudoun has attracted the headquarters for numerous tech companies, and benefits economically from the Washington Dulles International Airport which lies within its borders. The rural economy is still strong in the western part of the county which has flourishing equine and wine industries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWJ%2BcXnRopqhnaOpeqS71Kerop2jYravecCmnKuhk5Z8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-keepin-it-gangsta-remix-by-fabolous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Keepin it Gangsta (Remix) by Fabolous</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./samantha-pollino.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Samantha Pollino</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
