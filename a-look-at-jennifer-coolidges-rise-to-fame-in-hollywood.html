gained critical acclaim for her roles in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Netflix short series The Watcher</a> and HBO Max’ The White Lotus, however, actress Jennifer Coolidge has been landing roles in film and television for decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Delivering a supporting role in everything from episodes of Seinfeld to playing Stifler’s mom in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">American Pie franchise</a>, Coolidge always brought a unique look, drama and a contagious comedic flair to her roles.</p><p>She may have a net worth of $6 million today, but fans would bet that’s set to increase exponentially as Coolidge has officially arrived as a frontrunner in popular shows; starring as the lead character, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">lending her voice</a> to animated films and raking in the awards for her performances.</p><p>Check out how Coolidge has progressed over the course of 50 years or more.</p><h2 id=the-early-years-of-coolidge>The Early&nbsp;Years Of&nbsp;Coolidge</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 61-year-old actress was born in Boston and at one time, thought she may play the clarinet professionally. Her love for the orchestra was a natural springboard into the drama programs in high school. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Coolidge planned on becoming a dramatic actress, frequently referencing <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Meryl Streep</a> as her inspiration. After finding her love for comedy and receiving positive feedback for her natural comedic timing, she made a switch to playing the funny role we all know and love.</p><h2 id=landing-small-roles>Landing Small Roles</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coolidge started out small, with roles in <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">an episode of Seinfeld </a>and a small role in the film A Night at the Roxbury, starring comedians Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. In those early years, the actress worked at a bar in New York with up-and-coming star <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock</a>. While Bullock’s career took off, Coolidge was repeatedly told she wasn’t pretty enough but all of that changed when she landed the role she’s been known for over the years.</p><h2 id=her-big-break>Her Big Break</h2><p>In 1999, Coolidge played Jeanine Stifler, better known as Stifler’s mom in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">hit comedy franchise</a> American Pie. Playing a seductive older woman to a group of teens, Coolidge gained popularity with her wit and good looks. She reprised her role in the franchise in 2001 and again in 2003 for American Wedding. Just two years later, Coolidge landed a supporting role opposite <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon</a> in Legally Blonde to huge success at the box office and she returned to the role in Legally Blond 2: Red, White & Blonde.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the height of her film success, Coolidge also starred in 2004’s A Cinderella Story opposite Hillary Duff and the unique Lemony Snicket novel to television series, A Series of Unfortunate Events.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">8 Ways Hilary Duff Earns & Spends Her $25 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=becoming-a-familiar-voice>Becoming A Familiar Voice</h2><p>Coolidge has a distinctive voice and dramatic tone, in which <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">animated studios </a>latched on to quickly. In the mid-1990’s she had already lent her voice to the adult animated show, King of the Hill. As her career soared, fans could <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">recognize that unique voice</a> in feature films like Robots and Aunt Fanny’s Tour of Booty, a follow up short to the Blue Sky Studios hit. In the last few years, we’ve heard Coolidge behind characters in The Fungies, Rick and Morty, The Emoji Movie and Fish Hooks to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=finally-achieveing-stardom>Finally Achieveing Stardom</h2><p>To date, Coolidge has found her success in films and television shows ranging from <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler</a>’s Click to Beauty & the Briefcase with frequent co-star, Hillary Duff. Most recently, the star has gained notice for her work on Netflix’s The Watcher alongside Naomi Watts and Mia Farrow as well as <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">her turn as Tanya McQuoid in The White Lotus </a>as a self-absorbed woman whose mother recently died and she’s seeking inner peace. Also in 2023, Coolidge will star in the Netflix comedy, We Have a Ghost and alongside Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel in Shotgun Wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=awards-and-recognition>Awards And Recognition</h2><p>It was her turn in The White Lotus that earned Coolidge a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Golden Globe</a> and Primetime Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in Television. In addition, the actress received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Female Performance. In 2023, Coolidge was cited as being one of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">TIME Magazine’</a>s Most Influential People.

In fact, just this year, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">the animal lover was recognized by PETA</a> for her commitment to animal liberation. She was crowned ‘Vegan Queen” this past March. In addition, she starred in a 2023 Super Bowl ad for vegan brand, e.l.f. beauty. She’s also supported causes related to AIDS assistance among others.</p><h2 id=a-movie-set-like-mansion>A Movie-Set-Like Mansion</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, the comedian owns two homes: one in Hollywood and the other in New Orleans. Prior to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Hurricane Katrina</a>, Coolidge purchased a historic mansion in the area and then became involved in the city restoration after tragedy struck. Her mansion has also served as a filming location. The 2017, Sofia Coppola civil war drama, The Beguiled was filmed there. The $10 million <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">home has been considered haunted</a> and includes interior décor like dark oil paintings on the walls, warm candle lit hallways, paired with a scary annual Coolidge Halloween party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Are Animal Rights Activists</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">INSIDER</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmmaRit6a6zaKdnqpdmLywuMidnp6rXae2tLGMraZmnpGism61zWafqKScrsSwu8No</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-vicky-wright-die-tribute-pours-in-as-bobby-davros-fiancee-has-died-at-63.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How did Vicky Wright die?
