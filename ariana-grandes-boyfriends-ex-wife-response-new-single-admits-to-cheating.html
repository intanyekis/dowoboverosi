This is not an interpretation. It is her literal words."</p><p>The insider emphasized that Ariana’s album clarifies any misunderstanding around the situation, and the singer clearly doesn’t care that fans know she (allegedly) went after a married man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Ariana left nothing up to interpretation," the source went on. "She spelled it out and those close to Lilly believe she did this because she is upset that Ethan’s divorce is still dragging out. She wants him all to herself and feels that—because he is still legally married—she cannot truly have him.”</p><p>They added, “Everyone close to Lilly, and who knows Ethan, is just waiting for karma to slap him and Ariana in the face.
