Some were on the verge of success while others were easily-recognized celebrities. The main cast members - <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Matthew Perry</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong> - all became massive stars with the success of the show.</p><p>The cast members have been earning money since the series concluded. Reportedly, the show yields around $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. The main cast gets two percent of that amount, meaning each of them earns $20 million a year, just from the show. Their earnings help make <a href=#>the core six cast members some of the richest out of the overall cast of the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reportedly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest stars are also still earning money from the sitcom</a>. Vincent Ventresca, who appeared as Fun Bobby, Monica Gellar's love interest, in two episodes, explained that he's paid $2,000 every year. He told The Guardian, "I get about $2,000 a year in residuals, and I only did two episodes, per Grazia. Ventresca's comment means there is reason to believe the celebrities who made guest appearances, including Elliot Gould and Christina Pickles, get paid $1,000 a year for each episode they appeared in.</p><p>Gould and Pickles played Ross and Monica Geller's parents on the show. Throughout Friends' ten seasons, Gould appeared in 20 episodes as Jack Geller, and Pickles guest starred in 19 episodes as Judy Geller.</p><p>Based on the number of episodes they appear in, it seems Gould and Pickles are still making thousands from their work on Friends . Gould is likely earning $20,000 a year in residuals, while Pickles earns $19,000 per year for her appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-gould-and-pickles-enjoyed-working-on-the-show>Both Gould And Pickles Enjoyed Working On The Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/judy.jpg><p>Many who appeared as guest stars on Friends have opened up about their experiences while working on the show. Several celebrities who guest starred on the series loved being on the show and working with the main cast members. However, others disliked or even hated their time on the hit series. For example, <a href=#>Kathleen Turner, an iconic guest star, absolutely hated the cast</a>.</p><p>Gould and Pickles have been open about how much they enjoyed working on the show and with the cast.</p><p>"We made this at a time in my life where I certainly was maturing and getting older and growing into other roles," Gould told E!

Gould appeared with Pitt in the Ocean's 11 film series, and Pickles played Pitt's mother in Legends of the Fall.</p><p>Gould opened up about Pitt coming to see Aniston. "Bradley came to meet his wife, he was married to Jennifer (Aniston) at that point and Jennifer liked for me and Brad to hang out together. You know, I like him a lot.
