Let's take a look at where the two stand.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-never-appeared-on-the-39-joe-rogan-experience-39-podcast>Dwayne Johnson Never Appeared On The 'Joe Rogan Experience' Podcast</h2><p>Throughout his many years as a podcast host, and the top one in terms of viewers, it is a big surprise to many fans that Dwayne Johnson never went on 'The Joe Rogan Experience', despite the fact that he is the most sought-after guest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, DJ has a crazy busy schedule, however, he hasn't avoided other interviews. Back in the day, Johnson made a few appearances on the 'Howard Stern Show', which could be a considered a rival of Joe Rogan's in this day and age.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Joe Rogan Refuses To Appear On This Show Despite Fans Wanting Otherwise</a></span></p><p>Fans remain hopeful that DJ might finally appear on the podcast - the actor himself has expressed interest in the past on going on the show, especially due to all the requests from the fans. Rogan had also admitted to being a huge fan of the actor and his way of life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It remains to be seen if he'll ever go on the show but given the recent complications to take place between the two, the seems to be further away from a possibility.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-defended-joe-rogan-following-his-spotify-misinformation-controversy>Dwayne Johnson Defended Joe Rogan Following His Spotify Misinformation Controversy</h2><p>At least we can all agree that Joe Rogan did the right thing, by taking to Instagram and acknowledging all the mistakes that he made during interviews.

However, the hype was all short-lived, as some anti-Joe Rogan followers bashed DJ for his comment, especially given some of Rogan's other controversies from the past.</p><p>DJ would later take back his comments in the days that followed because of more controversy.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-changed-his-opinion-on-joe-rogan-following-a-tweet-by-don-winslow>Dwayne Johnson Changed His Opinion On Joe Rogan Following A Tweet By Don Winslow</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was Don Winslow, an international best-selling author that might've caused complications in Johnson and Rogan's relationship. He tweeted out, "Dear @TheRock, You're a hero to many people and using your platform to defend Joe Rogan, a guy that used and laughed about using the N word dozens of times, is a terrible use of your power. Have you actually listened to this man's many racist statements about Black people?"</p><p>DJ would respond to the tweet, revealing that he hadn't known about the allegations, "Dear @donwinslow, Thank you so much for this I hear you as well as everyone here 100% I was not aware of his N word use prior to my comments, but now I've become educated to his complete narrative. Learning moment for me. Mahalo, brother and have a great & productive weekend.

"Now, I haven’t said it in years, but for a long time, when I would bring that word up, like, if it would come up in conversation and instead of saying the n-word, I would just say the word — I thought as long as it was in context, people would understand what I was doing,” he explained.</p><p>Given The Rock's words and what was recently revealed, it seems as though it may have put a huge dent in a relationship that was at one point a close one behind the scenes.</p><p>DJ appearing on the podcast seems less likely.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>This Musician Turned Down A Guest Spot On 'The Joe Rogan Experience'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsJmpo7Juts6hpaynnmK3sLGMq6agmZ5isLC5z6WgnJmkmrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZp2am6SofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-miki-matsubara-death-cause-uterine-cervix-cancer-composer-husband-and-children-today-details-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Miki Matsubara Death Cause Uterine Cervix Cancer?
