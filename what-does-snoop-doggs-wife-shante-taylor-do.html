She went to Long Beach Polytechnic High School where she met Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. – the guy that soon became Snoop Dogg.

Despite nearly divorcing, the pair has renewed their vows and persevered through the difficult times.</p><p><a href=#>Snoop filed for divorce from Shante</a> in 2004 for “irreconcilable differences,” but he didn’t go through with it in the end.

She has always been my final gut check with all my decisions, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without her. I am grateful to have her as my official manager, helping to build the Snoop Dogg empire together,” Snoop said in a press release cited by Forbes.</p><p>Shante also couldn’t be happier with the role, she told in an interview: “He knows that he can always trust me. So he wanted the world to know he had his wife by his side, helping him. He wanted a strong female to lead. And of course, that’s me. I’m the boss lady.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from being Snoop’s manager, Shante is also the founder of Boss Lady Entertainment.
