In many cases, those fans have had Hill's back when <a href=#>Don Lemon complained about their first meeting</a> or when the actor <a href=#>decided not to do interviews about one of his movies</a>.</p><p>However, once Hill was recently accused of mistreating an ex-girlfriend, that changed the way many former fans felt about him. As it turns out, however, the recent accusations against Hill aren't the first time he has been the subject of controversy.</p><h2 id=why-jonah-hill-39-s-ex-girlfriend-labeled-him-quot-emotionally-abusive-quot>Why Jonah Hill's Ex-Girlfriend Labeled Him "Emotionally Abusive"</h2><p>In July 2023, Jonah Hill suddenly found himself the topic of controversy. While Hill is currently involved with <a href=#>his girlfriend and baby mama Olivia Millar</a>, he previously dated a surfer named Sarah Brady for a year. On July 7th, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brady began calling Hill out on social media</a> and posted screengrabs of what she claims are her text conversations with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jonah-hill-and-sarah-brady-before-their-breakup.jpg><p>Alongside one of the screengrabs Brady posted, she wrote a quick statement imploring women in similar situations to get out. “This is a warning to all girls. If your partner is talking to you like this, make an exit plan. Call me if you need an ear.”</p><p>In the screengrabs, the person Brady says is Hill can be seen instructing her to remove revealing photos of herself from social media. Follow-up messages show that Brady tried to comply which was a "good start" but she didn't remove enough photos according to the person she says was Hill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It’s not my place to teach you. I’ve made my boundaries clear. You refuse to let go of some of them and you’ve made that clear and I hope it makes you happy.” In a different text thread that Brady says was with Hill, he further outlines his boundaries and what he won't accept from her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Would Have Never Guessed Jonah Hill Struggles With Anxiety Based On How Well His Movies Were Rated</a></span></p><p>“Plain and simple: If you need: surfing with men, boundaryless inappropriate friendships with men, to model, to post pictures of yourself in a bathing suit, to post sexual pictures, friendships with women who are in unstable places and from your wild recent past beyond getting lunch or coffee or something respectful, I am not the right partner for you."</p><p>The text exchange continues, "If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it and there are no hard feelings. These are my boundaries for romantic partnership. My boundaries with you are based on the ways these actions have hurt our trust.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jonah-hill-ex-girlfriend-sarah-brady-slammed-him-for-being-a-narcissist-in-an-endless-instagram-story-post.jpg><p>In the rest of the text exchanges Brady says were with Hill, he consistently brings up what can and can't be done by her if she wants to still be involved with him. In many cases, the person who allegedly is Hill blamed Brady's past actions for his boundaries.</p><h2 id=why-did-jonah-hill-publicly-apologize>Why Did Jonah Hill Publicly Apologize?</h2><p>During Jonah Hill's time in the spotlight, there have been controversies that surrounded the actor long before anything about his text messages came to light. A perfect example of that is after accusations surfaced against James Franco, Hill's association with his former multiple-time co-star became problematic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jonah-hill-and-james-franco-laughing.jpg><p>Fortunately for Hill, he wasn't accused of having any involvement in Franco's alleged misdeeds, and he wasn't as closely associated with the actor as Seth Rogen. As a result, Hill was able to move past the Franco situation quickly and unscathed.</p><p>On the other hand, after Hill was filmed by a paparazzo in 2014, he wasn't able to move on painlessly. That is because Hill said something that deeply offended a lot of people.</p><p>In 2014, Jonah Hill's career was absolutely on fire. In 2013, Hill starred in The Wolf of Wall Street and This Is the End and in 2014 he headlined How to Train Your Dragon 2 and 22 Jump Street. Hill also had a cameo role in 2014's The Lego Movie as he lent his voice to The Green Lantern.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has Jonah Hill Been Able To Maintain His Weight Loss And Does He Follow A Certain Diet Or Workout Routine?</a></span></p><p>Amid all that success, the headlines about Hill suddenly became overwhelmingly negative. Hill would respond to the controversy by making the rounds to apologize for his actions in multiple venues. That begs an obvious question, what did Hill do that upset so many people?</p><p>In June 2014, TMZ published a video that showed Hill and a couple of his friends walking down a street in public. In this case, the video was taken by a member of the paparazzi who was following Hill and occasionally trying to talk to the star.</p><p>Early in the video, a different one of the paparazzo who was present brought up Channing Tatum. In response, a clearly very annoyed Hill could be heard mockingly saying "you're such a cool guy". From there, the paparazzo who recorded the video can be heard complimenting Hill's shorts, perhaps mockingly, which he calls "pretty sexy".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jonah-hill.jpg><p>In the moments that followed, there is some difficult-to-hear conversation which is followed by the paparazzo saying, "If you change your mind, I'll still be the same, I'm sure. If you decide to come back."</p><p>After several more seconds of silence, the paparazzo who recorded the video of Hill can be heard saying, "Have a good day. Enjoy." Instead of returning the sentiment, Hill told the paparazzo off and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called the man recording him a homophobic slur</a> that starts with the letter F.</p><p>Suffice it to say, many people were very angry when the recording of what Hill said made it on TMZ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jonah Hill Turned Down A Franchise Worth Over $1 Billion In Fear He Would Get Typecast</a></span></p><p>While Hill's camp was silent at first, it didn't take long for that to change. Within a few days of TMZ's report, Hill went on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took a moment to apologize</a>. Earlier the same day, Hill apologized to the public when he was interviewed by Howard Stern.</p><p>During his Tonight Show appearance, Hill started to talk about his remarks by giving the situation more context. According to Hill, the paparazzo he said the slur to had been insulting him and his family before the video clip the world saw began.</p><p>Furious at what the paparazzo said to him about his loved ones, Hill ultimately decided to lash out. As Hill explained to Fallon, that took the form of him calling the paparazzo "the most hurtful word I could think of at that moment.” After explaining the backstory, Jill went on to express how regretful he was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jonah-hill-and-jimmy-fallon-on-the-set-of-the-tonight-show.jpg><p>“I didn’t mean this in the sense of the word, I didn’t mean it in a homophobic way. [But] I think that doesn’t matter, how you mean things doesn’t matter…words have weight and meaning. The word I chose was grotesque and no one deserves to say or hear words like that.”</p><p>“My heart’s broken, and I am genuinely and deeply sorry to anyone who has ever been affected by that term in their life. I know I’m usually funny and stuff, but this wasn’t funny, it was stupid, and I deserve the s**t I’m going to get for it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his Tonight Show appearance, Hill also advised viewers to learn from his mistake. “If someone says something that hurt you or angers you, use me as an example of what not to do. Don’t respond with hatred or anger, because you are just adding more ugliness to the world.” It is worth noting that prior to the incident, Hill had spoken out in defense of the LGBTQ+ community more than once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRnXqptculZKGho6m8s8WMqJ1mq5OWu6Wty6xkm52WpL%2BmecSxZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmq5Gnrql5wauYnbFdobKit8SdZJ2ho6nCs67Ip55mrJWtwbR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-silverman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Silverman Bio, Marriage, Husband, Net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./edge-disrespect-randy-orton-retirement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Edge Disrespected Randy Orton When He Retired</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
