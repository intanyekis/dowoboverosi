The Rated R Superstar successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship the night before only to reveal on Raw that a build up of injuries over the course of his career meant that he'd have to hang up his boots early.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:center><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>EVERYTHING EDGE HAS BEEN UP TO SINCE RETIRING</a></strong></p><p>Edge is mainly remembered for two things during his long run in WWE. The first is his time with lifelong friend Christian during which the two of them helped revolutionize tag team wrestling. The other is for his time as a singles star where he racked up multiple World Titles. Well, other than those runs, Edge also enjoyed a multitude of other career highlights, one of which was a run alongside <a href=#>Randy Orton</a> as one half of Rated RKO.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DX-and-Rated-RKO.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Orton was clearly a big part of Edge's career and last week, the two reunited of sorts when The Viper appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edge and Christian's podcast</a>. The three of them discussed the events following Edge's retirement speech and Orton recalled his former tag partner totally ignoring him when he got backstage. Orton put his hand out, but Edge was so in the moment that he completely blanked him. Edge then talked about leaving Orton and <a href=#>Dolph Ziggler</a> out of his Hall of Fame speech, telling his and Christian's guest that he was so sorry, that he loved him, and that Randy was, of course, a huge part of his career.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>EDGE AND CHRISTIAN LOVE ORTON, BUT WHO HATES HIM?</a></strong></p><p>Edge forgetting to mention Orton in his Hall of Fame speech isn't a topic that he has&nbsp;reserved for when Orton was on the podcast. The Canadian has often recalled how he knew that it was inevitable he would forget some influential names from his career and also told&nbsp;his wife Beth Phoenix not to worry too much as she prepared her Hall of Fame speech as you're bound to forget someone important.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His retirement and induction into the Hall of Fame are arguably two of the biggest moments in Edge's career, or at least his post-ring career. Both of those occasions emotions would have been running high, and he likely wouldn't have been aware of much going on around him. If you've not already listened to the podcast with&nbsp;Orton, then it's definitely worth your time. If you do it'll soon become clear how vital Orton was to Edge's career and vice versa and the tremendous friendship and respect the pair of them have for each other to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnlZm0pnnDoqqrnaOlsqTAjKuYp5ypYryzwM6nZKudpJ6%2FprnEp6to</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonah-hill-history-of-scandals-before-ex-girlfriend-sarah-brady-leaked-disturbing-texts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonah Hill Has A History Of Scandals Long Before Ex-Girlfriend Sarah Brady Leaked His Disturbing Tex</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elina-svitolina-husband-gael-monfils-age-wife-ranking-titles-net-worth-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elina Svitolina Husband: Gal Monfils Age, Wife, Ranking, Titles, Net Worth, Siblings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
