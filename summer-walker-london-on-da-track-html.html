The singer also claimed she was done with London and that Eboni could have him back. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"London, you're&nbsp;a pathological liar, narcissist, be gaslighting & everyone knows it," she wrote on Instagram stories. "I'm happy, move on...but now I give him back [to Eboni] and you STILL mad, it's giving obsessive."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the follow-up post, London's baby mama, Summer, asked him to take away the car and other valuables he had gifted her while wishing him to leave her and her kid alone.</p><h2>Eboni and Erica Racine&nbsp;Slammed Summer Walker</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Soon after Summer posted debatable statements on her social media, Eboni — who shares a daughter, Paris, with London — took to her Instagram to share a series of posts, making a few claims of her own. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She first disputed Summer's claims by stating that she was the one who seemed upset, and she was calling London, whose real name is London Tyler Holmes, a deadbeat just because he didn't want to be involved with her.</p><p>"Summer youre a Delusional...lil girl you ran out the room whining wig finna fly off cryin! Cut it out [sic]," Eboni, who has over 17,000 followers on Instagram, wrote on her Instagram stories. "You in there singing me that same old song tryin to get London back."</p><p>The internet celebrity also clarified she was not involved in any physical relationship with London before adding that London usually spent time with their daughter, which she was happy about. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The drama continued when&nbsp;Erica Racine — who shares a son,&nbsp;London Jr., with London — took the opportunity to defend London. She shared a video of herself along with him and their son, which was captured in a <a href=# rel=follow>hospital</a>.</p><p>In the clip, London held his son's hands and helped him walk, as Erica captioned the post, writing, "Doesn’t look like a deadbeat to me."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>It Didn’t End There</h2><p>After&nbsp;Eboni and Erica's statements defending&nbsp;London came out,&nbsp;the 'Body' singer&nbsp;immediately rushed on to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">address all of the issues</a> with London, Eboni, and Erica on Instagram live. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Summer stated she went&nbsp;live because&nbsp;she didn't have their&nbsp;numbers and requested them to&nbsp;leave her alone. She&nbsp;continued to say that&nbsp;she previously tried to unite all of London’s children so that her daughter Bubbles could know her siblings.</p><p>But she&nbsp;claimed that things went left when she&nbsp;tried to have a sit-down conversation with Eboni regarding the matter. She even said Eboni and Erica were clout chasers&nbsp;and called out London for having an issue with her dating a new man.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Summer later ended her live video, saying she would not talk about the matter anymore. Well, we'll have to wait and see if that comes true or not.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKulorqmvoywmKWjlad6rbvNnaanZZ%2BjeqWtjK2pmpubY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toya-wright-brothers-murder-arrest-495931.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Suspect Arrested For The Murder Of Toya Wright's Brothers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rosa-lee-herron.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rosa Lee Futrell Herron Metropolitan Funeral</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
