Her spirit is not in her body and she is stuck between life and the afterlife.</p><p>Audiences are curious if the series has been renewed for season 2. Although there is no official announcement, it will probably be back on our screen with the second part if not more.</p><p>The series is directed by Brian Dannelly, Hannah Macpherson, Max Winkler, and Oran Zegman. The credit for the writing goes to Maria Nguyen,&nbsp;Megan Trinrud, Nate Trinrud, and more.</p><p>The writers of the show shocked the audiences in the final episode.

The soap opera can be renewed multiple times until the creators are done telling a story.</p><p>Limited series are longer than mini-series and have only one season. The creators already decide the number of episodes that they are going to launch onscreen.</p><p>Such shows have a defined beginning, middle, and end. However, it is different in the case of School Spiritis as the end is not clear and precise.</p><p>There is a curiosity in the viewer’s mind as to what will Maddie do. Will she always remain in limbo or will she track her body and work towards gaining it back?</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=creators-have-thoughts-on-the-second-season></span>Creators Have Thoughts On The Second Season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In an interview with&nbsp;J-14, the show’s co-creator Nate Trinrud revealed that they have many thoughts regarding the potential second season.</p><p>Not only audiences, but even the creators are hoping for the next part.

The show has mentioned her name from the beginning but has not shown her face.</p><p>If the second season is announced by Paramount Plus, the audition for Janet will begin. Janet, her character, and her purpose is a mystery for now.</p><p>When Maddie joins the spirit support group, she discovers that one of the seats used to be for Janet. Janet is no longer in the support group so everyone thinks that she has crossed over.</p><p>Maddie continues her investigation. Meanwhile, she helps Dawn to make peace with her demise. Dawn lets go of her friends who talk badly about her.</p><p>Following that, Dawn crosses over and as she ascends, the lights flicker. None of the spirits realize it is happening before, ensuring that Janet is still amid them.</p><p>Why did Janet leave the group if she had not crossed over? Did she have problems with other spirits or a different plan?</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=janet-took-over-maddies-body></span>Janet Took Over Maddie’s Body<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Janet possesses Maddie’s body and moves from the town as shown in the final part.

He claimed that he perished&nbsp;in a fire that a student started.</p><p>The chemistry teacher revealed that he took responsibility and saved all his students. He passed away in the incident and came into the afterlife.</p><p>When Dawn crosses over, others get curious about Janet’s demise. Wally checks the schools’ newspapers to find out what happened to Janet.</p><p>He reaches the edition of 1960 (when Janet claimed she perished) but finds no report. He moves backward chronologically and finds she passed in a fire with Mr. Martin.</p><p>To calm their curiosity, Wally and Charley go to the fallout center where they discover that the fire was started by Mr. Martin.
