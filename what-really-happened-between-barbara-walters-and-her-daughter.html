In fact, Walters, who was a rising star on ABC's Today at the time, didn’t even take maternity leave. "I really didn’t want the biological mother to know that Jackie had been adopted by us,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she later explained</a> to NBC News. “I just kept right on working.”</p><h2 id=juggling-a-broadcasting-career-and-parenting-proved-an-arduous-task-for-barbara-walters><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Juggling A Broadcasting Career And Parenting Proved An Arduous Task For Barbara Walters</span></h2><p>At the time of Jacqueline’s adoption, Walter’s had just joined ABC’s Today, and was well on her way to becoming a preeminent newswoman.

It was called crank then, but it’s now methamphetamine. Quaaludes were all over the place. Valium. And the drugs numbed all the other feelings,” she would later tell NBC News. “But it didn’t take away the issues that I had. They got bigger and bigger.

After one agonizing month, Barbara Walters decided to take drastic action; forcefully enrolling Jacqueline in an intervention program in Idaho.</p><p>Although Jacqueline initially resented her mother’s action, she would later admit that she’d “have been dead” were it not for the timely intervention. Years after this ordeal, Jacqueline would establish her own intervention program, which offered much-needed support to troubled teenage girls before it closed down in 2008.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Of Barbara Walters' Biggest Celebrity Interviews</a></span></p><h2 id=barbara-walters-wished-she-rsquo-d-spent-more-time-with-jacqueline><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Barbara Walters Wished She’d Spent More Time With Jacqueline</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her 2014 special, Barbara Walters: Her Story TV, Walters admitted that her demanding career might have interfered with her parenting, and wished she’d spent more time with Jacqueline.</p><p>“On your deathbed, are you going to say, ‘I wish I spent more time in the office?’ No. You’ll say, ‘I wish I spent more time with my family,’ and I do feel that way,” she said. “I wish I had spent more time with my Jackie.”</p><h2 id=what-is-jacqueline-guber-doing-now><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Jacqueline Guber Doing Now?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/barbara-walters-and-her-daughter-jacqueline-guber.jpg><p>Unlike her mother, who seemed to carry an innate proclivity for the limelight, Jacqueline favors a more reclusive lifestyle.
