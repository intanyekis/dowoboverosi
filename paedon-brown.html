He was born on<strong> August 7, 1998.</strong></p><h2>Educational Background</h2><p>Brown spent his young years in Las Vegas, where he moved with his family when he was just 14 years old. He completed his high school education at the nearby Las Vegas&nbsp;Centennial High School. He followed this by joining the National Guard Bootcamp, where he graduated in <strong>2019</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/27/58410442_2133557520046377_6642451702955458664_n%20(1)-1664275790966.jpg><h2>His Distant Relationship With His Stepmom</h2><p>Brown's father, Kody, has had four different wives. One of his ex-wives is <strong>Meri Brown</strong>, with whom he was married from 1990 to 2014. Brown revealed later that he never got along with Meri, even more so than his other stepmoms.</p><p>The reality show<i> 'Sister Wives'</i> premise was that the family life would be documented. Even though they tried to show that things were good between them, fans couldn't help but notice that their body language told a different story.</p><p>Later, Brown did bring this to everyone's attention, saying that the fan's speculation is indeed correct. Some of them didn't get along. In the case of Brown, he didn't get along with his stepmom Meri. He also said that he was asked not even to mention her.</p><h2>What Is a Sister Wives?</h2><p><i>Sister Wives</i> is an American reality television show. The show aired on the TLC channel and documented the life of The Brown Family.</p><p>The show followed the life of this Polygamist family. They documented and showed their day-to-day lives and how they lived and handled family matters which one can assume would be a lot in such a large family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/27/MV5BZjM2M2FmNTctNmEwZC00ZDJlLWFjNGYtMmU1YjZlNjJhOGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_%20(1)-1664275651504.jpg><p>The show may have a poor rating on IMDb with 4.3 out of 10 stars, but it acted as a stepping stone to help them advance their career. And also helped the family gain some fame and money along the way.</p><h2>How Much Money Did Sister Wives Family Make?</h2><p>Despite all the negative reviews from critics and fans, <i>Sister Wives</i> was a pretty successful show.

But, people soon found out their relationship was even worse than expected.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>When the famous TV show <i>Sister's Wives</i> ended, Brown revealed how his father is a hypocrite as in he would tell others to do things a certain way and never did it himself.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't just Brown that disliked his father.

She posted it on her Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow>@aurora.christian</a>. Michael is seen going down on one knee in the post while she is shocked. The caption in the post says</p><p>SURPRISE!

She had six children with him.</p><p>She was one of the most beloved characters in the show, with people always sympathizing with her over Kody.
