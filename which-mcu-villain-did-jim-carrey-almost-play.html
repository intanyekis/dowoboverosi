Franchises like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and Furious</a> know how to land the right talent for each role, and because of this, they are able to shine bright whenever they hit theaters and dominate the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim Carrey may not seem like someone who would appear in a superhero movie, but once upon a time, the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a></strong> was interested in bringing him on board. Naturally, this would have changed things drastically, and while Carrey could have done some cool things, the right man got the job.</p><p>Let’s take a look and see which MCU villain Jim Carrey was considered for!</p><h2 id=he-was-in-consideration-for-loki>He Was In Consideration For Loki</h2><p>In the earlier stages of the MCU, the franchise was looking to get characters involved that could last for more than one film, and it was important to land actors who could bring a character to life in a convincing way while getting over with audiences. During this time, none other than Jim Carrey was in consideration for the character <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loki</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was all taking place during Phase One of the MCU, meaning that a lot of what we got to see wasn’t even in play yet. Before&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;hit theaters and introduced some key characters, there had only been 3 films released in the franchise.&nbsp;Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Iron Man 2 were successful releases that got the ball rolling, and the announcement of&nbsp;Thor got people into a frenzy.</p><p>Prior to being in consideration for the role of Loki, Jim Carrey had appeared in a comic book movie before. Whether people realize it or not,&nbsp;The Mask was, in fact, based on a comic book run, and the mask used in the film was created by none other than Loki himself!</p><p>Carrey had flexed his range on the big screen by this point, steering away from exclusively comedic roles to take part in movies that allowed him to do something a bit different. Clearly, Marvel thought that he could hit the comedic moments for the character while also being able to crank up the dramatics for any scene that called for it.</p><p>Despite this, the studio would ultimately continue on their search for the right person to play Loki.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Every MCU Character Who’s Been Recast (So Far)</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-hiddleston-gets-the-gig>Tom Hiddleston Gets The Gig</h2><p>Sometimes, things work out in ways that we may never expect, and for Tom Hiddleston, this was precisely the case when it came to landing the role of Loki in the MCU. He has been a perfect fit as the character, but back before he was officially cast in the role, he had actually auditioned for the role of Thor.</p><p>This may come as a surprise to people, but Marvel was interested in bringing Hiddleston on board for the God of Thunder as opposed to the God of Mischief. Once Chris Hemsworth staked his claim as the character, the franchise was still able to find a good fit for Hiddleston as Thor’s brother.</p><p>When speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Fallon</a> about the audition process, Hiddleston would say, “At the time, they were looking for sort of less well-established actors so that the audience didn't have an association. They just wanted people to see these new characters, these new actors. The remit was if you were over six foot and you've got blonde hair, you could come and have a pop at it. I never auditioned for Loki, I only ever auditioned for Thor, which is nuts."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without ever giving an audition, Hiddleston landed the role of Loki and he never looked back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There Was A Huge Change Made To The Final Battle In ‘Avengers: Endgame’</a></span></p><h2 id=loki-s-show-debuts-in-may>Loki’s Show Debuts In May</h2><p>As we got to see through the first few phases of the MCU, Loki was an incredible character who played a huge part in everything that happened. Hiddleston was brilliant in the role, and Disney has decided to find a new avenue for the character to thrive.</p><p>It was recently announced that a Loki series will be debuting on Disney+ in 2021. It will come on the heels of two other MCU shows on the platform, meaning that Marvel fans are in for a huge treat all throughout 2021.</p><p>Hiddleston will be reprising his now iconic character, and if the previews for the project have anything to say, then this show is going to blow people away each week.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Some MCU Fans Think Peter Parker Will Team Up With Daredevil</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim Carrey could have done some cool things as Loki, but Tom Hiddleston wound up being the perfect person for the job.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which MCU Actress Almost Played Wonder Woman For DC?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqur9RmraKknJa2r3nDoptmopmieqSt0aucsmWRobqwv9Nmp6WZqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bananabrea-boyfriend-net-worth-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bananabrea- Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tiffany-haddish-drunk-history-561105.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tiffany Haddish Hilarious Tells Nazi Story On 'Drunk History'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
