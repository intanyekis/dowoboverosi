A story of chance, coincidence and luck,” the Doctor says.</p><h3>How Does Ncuti Gatwa Feel About Being the New Doctor?</h3><p>“There aren’t quite the words to describe how I’m feeling,” he said in a press release. “A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared. This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will endeavour my utmost to do the same.”</p><h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Doctor-Who-Ncuti-Gatwa-2023-Christmas-special.jpg></h3><h3>Who Is the 15th Doctor’s New Companion?</h3><p>BBC and Disney+, the U.S. streaming home for the new season, announced in November 2022 that <strong>Millie Gibson</strong> will portray Gatwa’s sidekick, Ruby Sunday.</p><p>“Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor’s companion,” Gibson said in a November 2022 statement. “It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get started.”</p><p>Gatwa is just as pumped. “Far too excited to sail the universe and battle monsters with this one,” the Barbie star captioned an Instagram announcement at the time. “Believe me we got SO much in store for you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ncuti-Gatwa-as-Doctor-Who.jpg><h3>What Does Ncuti Gatwa Look Like as The Doctor?</h3><p>In December 2022, Disney+ and BBC revealed the first photo of Gatwa and Gibson in their typical character costumes.
