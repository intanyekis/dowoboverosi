Despite the constant rumors linking the two romantically, Michele, who was dating actor Theo Stockman at the time, continued to set the record straight.</p><p class=dh>In 2011, Michele split from her boyfriend, and barely a year later, her friendship with Monteith had blossomed into something more serious. The "Glee" stars quickly became one of the most admired couples in Hollywood.</p><p class=dh>Michele even stood by Monteith's side, while he admitted himself into a treatment facility following a long battle with substance addiction. In July 2013, barely three months after voluntarily admitting himself into rehab, Lea Michele's boyfriend Monteith died from a toxic dose of heroin and alcohol.</p><p class=dh>In 2014, while appearing on the cover of TeenVogue, Lea Michele opened up about her struggles and how she has managed to stay strong despite her ex-boyfriend's tragic death.
