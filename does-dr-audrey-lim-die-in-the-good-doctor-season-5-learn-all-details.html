That is not to say that we will lose her. We adore her. But there will be difficulties ahead.”</p><p>He went on to say that he and Chang had already discussed Dr. Lim’s fate and that the actor is “excited” about what’s to come.</p><p>“Look, I think actors are concerned about their jobs on some level, but they also want juicy stuff to deal with,” Shore told the publication.</p><p>While Shore did not say whether Dr. Lim would survive the attack, he did say that he and the show’s writing team were interested in “challenging her physically,” which could imply that the character will return for Season 6.</p><h2><strong>Review of The Good Doctor Season 5 Episode 18</strong></h2><p>Season finales are almost always cliffhangers, but did we really need to end with Dr. Lim and Nurse Villanueva bleeding out on the floor?</p><p>It’s not surprising that Owen assaulted his ex-girlfriend. He was verbally abusing her and knew where she worked.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the abused partner decides to leave, abuse often escalates into violence, sometimes fatally.</p><p>While it was not Lim’s fault that Owen attacked Villanueva at the hospital, I wish someone had thought about it and increased security. I also wish we hadn’t ended the season with two women bleeding out on the floor.</p><h2><strong>Where to watch Good Doctor</strong></h2><p>You can watch Good Doctor all season on Hulu and Amazon Prime.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>‘Julia’ Renewed for Season 2 at HBO Max: Potential Release Date 2023 And Everything We Know So Far</a></li><li><a href=#>Ncis Season 19 Episode 20 Release Date, Spoiler, Recap, And When Is It Coming Out?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvDqJysZZSneqLBw6ucsmWcnrpusMieZKKmXam1pnnGqKadZZSksLW70WaqnpmjpLtugYylnJqqnmKurbiMnZytmZmhwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-oppenheim-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Oppenheim Net Worth How Much is Oppenheim Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steffy-end-marriage-finn-bring-sheila-back.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bold &amp;amp; Beautiful's Steffy Ends Her Marriage When Finn Brings Sheila Back?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
