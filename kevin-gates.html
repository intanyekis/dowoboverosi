The first verse has him riding around in his car listening to his own music with a girl. The girl wants to hear track six, which she considers her jam. Gates then goes on to describe their sexual encounter, with him being all she needs and their song probably being played in the background.</p><br><p>In the second verse, Gates describes a different woman who is looking at herself in the mirror, not liking what she sees. Gates then proceeds to reassure her and offer his own version of intimacy while also highlighting that it is their business only. He ends the verse with the line "Hit you with the Ruger, the bitch don't (jam)", which could be interpreted as a violent threat, but it's unclear.</p><br><p>The chorus is repeated between each verse and at the end of the song, with the title referring to a woman's favorite song, and Kevin Gates being all in-between, which she can't get enough of, hence it's probably on (jam).<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>It was cool</u><br>A narrator describes a habit of a man named Bernie to play Luther Vandross songs to someone over the phone.</p><br><p><u>And he'd get back on the phone, and say Bernie I got somethin' I want you to hear</u><br>Bernie becomes excited about sharing a new song he has found with his acquaintance.</p><br><p><u>And what you do players, is you get the phone and you hold it up to the speakers</u><br>Bernie's acquaintance is instructed on how to listen to the song Bernie wants to share.</p><br><p><u>And you let Luther do your talkin' for you</u><br>The artist implies that Bernie uses Luther's smooth voice to express his emotions.</p><br><p><u>Ridin' around in my whip, listenin' to my shit</u><br>The artist describes being in a car and listening to his own music.</p><br><p><u>She want to hear track six, she told me that's her (jam)</u><br>A woman expresses her liking for the sixth track of the singer's music, considering it her favorite (jam).</p><br><p><u>Baby girl said I got the title, got a nigga feelin' like Michael / Jackson, Jordan, don't matter to me they both (jam)</u><br>The woman's fondness for the singer's music has him feeling like a superstar, whether it's Michael Jackson or Jordan doesn't matter, because it all sounds great (jam).</p><br><p><u>I'm all in her head, she's all in my bed</u><br>The artist implies that his music occupies a special space in the woman's mind, and she occupies an equally important place in his bed.</p><br><p><u>I'm locked and loaded, ready to go like a gun that don't (jam)</u><br>The artist compares himself to a gun that doesn't jam, meaning that he's primed and ready for action.</p><br><p><u>I'm all in-between, that's all that she needs / Her body rockin', nobody stoppin', this song is probably on (jam)</u><br>The woman's being pleased by the artist's touch, and it's enough to make her dance to his music (jam).</p><br><p><u>Listen all you like</u><br>The singer invites the listener to keep paying attention to the song.</p><br><p><u>Tattoos showin' out the shower in the mirror, go to clickin' on the lights</u><br>The artist describes his intimate moment of clicking on the light switch and admiring the tattoos on his body in the mirror after showering.</p><br><p><u>And this ain't what you like (jam)</u><br>The singer acknowledges that this moment of self-reflection may not be everybody's 'jam' (type).</p><br><p><u>I can lay you on your back then I hit you with the pound game / Pin you down so you can't run, in and out game / Hit you from the back, probably get you with the mouth game / Ain't nobody business, this is our thing (jam)</u><br>The singer describes a sexual encounter with the woman, emphasizing his desire to keep it private and his expertise in various sexual techniques, all of which constitute their own kind of 'jam.'</p><br><p><u>Spit all in-between both cheeks, now I spread 'em</u><br>The singer describes a sexual act that may be considered graphic and not appropriate for all audiences.</p><br><p><u>Bet the neighbors know my name when you keep sayin' Kevin / Hands behind, I'ma stand behind you / Pullin' on your hair, lot of ass behind you (jam)</u><br>The artist implies that he's having a particularly noisy sexual encounter that might alert the neighbors. He also mentions his penchant for rough sex and dominance, which he believes is part of his 'jam.'</p><br><p><u>Got me sayin', 'ooh keep goin' with your moves' / Candles by the bed, God damn this a movie / Stuffin' you with dick while my finger in your booty / Hit you with the Ruger, the bitch don't (jam)</u><br>The artist describes his attraction to the woman as well as the romantic setting they are in.

He then describes dancing to his own music, noting that Strokin' from track number seven is specifically the song they are dancing to, which he considers her 'jam.'</p><br><p><u>Do you kiss with your friend? Oh you roll with your friends? / Start the car and I get in, we rollin' / Let the leaf hit the green, we smokin' / Slow motion coupe just floatin'</u><br>The artist, trying to get to know the woman better, asks about her friends and how she behaves around them. He then invites her to come with him, and they take a drive together, smoking some marijuana along the way. The car ride is described as pleasant and slow.</p><br><p><u>Kissin' on her finger with my hand on her breast / Tongue doin' circles round the ring of her nipple / Would you mind on repeat but she might be trippin' / Really, not really, sayin' it was her (jam)</u><br>The artist describes another sexual encounter he has had with the woman, this time focusing on sensuality and intimacy. He mentions using one of his own songs as the background music and implies that she may find it strange to listen to her partner's voice while they make love, but he still considers it her 'jam.'</p><br><p><u>Hit her right like Nikon do / Stays back on W / I'ma show her what this pipe game do / I'ma hit her till the sky turn blue / And I'ma jam on it, jam on it / Jam on it, jam on it / I'ma jam on it, jam on it, jam on it / I'ma jam on it, jam on it, jam on it</u><br>The singer implies that he has some prowess in the bedroom, detailing his sexual technique using metaphors based on active physical subjects like a Nikon camera or a car that can rev up. He emphasizes that he will satisfy the woman so completely that the sky will literally turn blue. He then repeats the phrase 'jam on it' as a mantra, emphasizing his belief that his entire performance is in sync with the woman's likes and wishes.</p><br><p><u>Ridin' around in my whip, listenin' to my shit / She want to hear track six, she told me that's her (jam) / Baby girl said I got the title, got a nigga feelin' like Michael / Jackson, Jordan, don't matter to me they both (jam) / I'm all in her head, she's all in my bed / I'm locked and loaded, ready to go like a gun that don't (jam) / I'm all in-between, that's all that she needs / Her body rockin', nobody stoppin', this song is probably on (jam)</u><br>The artist repeats the refrain from earlier in the song, where a woman indicates her liking for track six, comparing it to his sexual prowess and emphasizing how well their relationship works for both of them. They both have the same 'jam' and feel satisfied with each other's rapport.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Peermusic Publishing, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Micah Powell, Jamie Foxx, Marcellus Gilyard, Tremaine Aldon Neverson, Tyrone William Griffin Jr.</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIOVq7avq6aaq56rX3%2BOjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mia-x-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mia X Net Worth How Much is Mia X Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lawrence-other-celebrity-women-who-dont-care-to-have-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lawrence &amp;amp; Other Celebrity Women Who Don't Care To Have Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
