Besides obtaining recognition for his quick-witted responses and razor-sharp tongue in comedy, he also stands out for one particular quality - his imposing height. Vaughn stands at a towering height measuring 6' 5" and is listed as one of the tallest actors in Hollywood; only a few inches shorter than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who stands at 6' 8".</p><p>Born to a wealthy family in Minnesota, but grew up in Illinois and graduated from Lake Forest high school in 1988.&nbsp; The same year, he landed a Chevrolet commercial, and soon after he moved to Hollywood. Regarding his mother, Sharon Eileen, as the inspiration behind his career, he decided to take acting seriously in 1987 and since then has starred in movies alongside celebrities like Jennifer Aniston, <a href=#>Heather Graham</a>, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie. Here is how his acting career secured him a net worth of $50 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becoming-a-hollywood-giant>Becoming A Hollywood Giant</h2><p>Movie fanatics around the world would have to agree that Wedding Crashers is one of the most successful<a href=#> romantic comedies</a> of the 21st century. And a large portion of its value is owed to Vaughn's animated and sarcastic acting. However, like every other actor who started as a 'Nobody',&nbsp; and his career began years ago in 1989 when he guest-starred in the drama series, China Beach, with Dana Delaney and Michael Boatman. He also appeared in the police procedural series, 21 Jump Street, in which he shared the screen with future Hollywood A-lister, <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>. The Old School actor then appeared three times in the anthology television series, CBS Schoolbreak Specials, which has featured other celebrities such as Whoopi Goldberg, Malinda Williams, Martin Sheen, and Josh Hamilton to name a few. Vaughn's childhood love for theater and acting was finally being manifested, and his dreams of becoming a professional actor were coming true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a bit of amateur experience, he landed a role in his first movie in the 1993 football biographical drama, Rudy, based on the life of Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger, who played football at the University of Notre Dame. He appeared beside Sean Astin, Charles S. Dutton, and <a href=#>Jon Favreau</a>, grossing $22 million at the box office. He would team up with Jon Favreau again in 1996 for the comedy-drama, Swingers, which grossed $4.6 million against a $200,000 budget, which is a small but remarkable turnover for an independent film. His role in the movie essentially made him the next big thing in Hollywood, and the next movie he was cast in was Steven Spielberg's multi-million dollar movie franchise, <a href=#>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a>, which ended up grossing $618.6 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Onward into the 1990s, Vaughn would go on to star in movies such as Locusts (1997), alongside Kate Capshaw and Ashley Judd, A Cool Dry Place (1998) starring Monica Potter and Joey Lauren Adams, Return to Paradise (1998) which grossed $8.3 million, featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Jada Pinkett Smith, and Psycho (1998) starring Anne Heche, <a href=#>Julianne Moore</a>, and William H. Macy. Although quite a few of his movies at this time were box office bombs, Vince was off to a great start in his acting career, and his potential was actualized by the caliber of actors with whom he co-starred.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Anchorman: 9 Highest-Grossing Will Ferrell Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=2000s-and-beyond>2000s And Beyond</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the '90s were a test run, the 2000s were Vaughn's time to own the road!
