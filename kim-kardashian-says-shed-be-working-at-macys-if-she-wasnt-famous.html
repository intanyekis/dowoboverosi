Kim said <a href=#>she thinks she’d be working at Macy’s</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West Loses Six-Figures Selling Home Across The Street From Kim Kardashian</a></span></p><p>The SKIMS founder then shared that her own mother, Kris Jenner, struggles with guilty over pushing her kids into stardom. "Something that is hard for my mom is, she's been really sad, like what did I do?” Did I create them to get to this level where…" Kim trailed off.</p><p>Kim’s name was first catapulted into fame when a sex tape featuring her and singer Ray J was released. Kim has always maintained the video was meant to be private and has fuelled rumors her ex released the tape on his own.</p><p>However, last year, Ray J accused Kris Jenner of orchestrating the tape’s release to bolster Kim’s career at the expense of his own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I've never leaked anything. I have never leaked a sex tape in my life. It has never been a leak,” Ray told <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> . "It's always been a deal and a partnership between Kris Jenner and Kim and me and we've always been partners since the beginning of this thing.”</p><p>The fame from the tape led Kim’s family to score a reality television deal with E! and so Keeping Up with the Kardashians was created. KUWTK had over 20 seasons in its 14 seasons on the air, lasting from 2007 to 2021.</p><p>By the end of the show, the Kardashian-Jenners were reportedly earning millions per season. The notoriety also helped them promote their brands and businesses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The family then signed a deal for another show titled The Kardashians with Hulu, <a href=#>valued at $100 million</a>. The first season debuted in 2022, and it’s been going strong ever since.</p><p>Needless to say, Kris Jenner has helped her family create an empire thanks to their reality fame. Kim has various skincare, beauty, and fashion lines.</p><p>Het net worth is only slightly higher than that of her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, who created a makeup company based on speculation about her lip fillers. Kylie is close to having a billion-dollar net worth herself from the success.</p><p>It's fair to say that Kim as well as her family’s lives would’ve been very different if she didn’t pursue fame and did end&nbsp;up working at Macy’s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Ben Affleck & Jennifer Lopez Splurge On $60 Million Mansion With Dark Past</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Yahoo News!</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWaqmrGjYsCpscNmmZ5lp6S%2FrLXNoGSarF2irqTF0magn2WjnbJuw8Cspa1llpa6sMHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-wollover-htm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Wollover - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./howard-stern.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Howard Stern (Radio Host) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Children, Career, Net Worth, Fact</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
