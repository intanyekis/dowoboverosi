Somers <a href=#>played Chrissy on the beloved sitcom</a>, while the late <a href=#>John Ritter</a> played her roommate Jack.</p><p>The 8 Simple Rules alum died in 2003 at age 54, but his former costar had a solution for how a reboot could work without him. Somers thought John’s eldest son, <a href=#><strong>Jason Ritter</strong></a>, could play Chrissy and Jack’s son, while John would appear in digital form.</p><p>“I had suggested this to Jason’s people and that the show would be me and Jason, but that John would appear as a hologram because it’d be like he was back and alive,” she explained on Tuesday. “But Jason doesn’t want to do anything reminiscent of what his father did.”</p><p>Three’s Company aired for eight seasons on ABC from 1977 to 1984. The series followed Chrissy and her roommate Janet (<a href=#><strong>Joyce DeWitt</strong></a>) after they agreed to let Jack move in with them despite their landlord’s prohibition on mixed-gender unmarried people living together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Suzanne-Somers-Pitched-Threes-Company-Reboot-With-John-Ritter-Hologram-002.jpg><p>Somers hasn’t done a sitcom <a href=#>since Step by Step ended in 1998</a>, but she explained that a Three’s Company reboot would entice her back to the small screen. “That was the last time I got kinda turned on by thinking about doing a series again,” the California native explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Without Jason, however, she wouldn’t consider it. “The marketing is so much better. Suzanne Somers and John Ritter’s son, Jason,” she said of the Parenthood alum, 42. “And I guess that’s what he didn’t want, but that’s a marketer’s dream. Suzanne Somers and Fred Schmoe is not a marketer’s dream, you know what I mean?”</p><p>When Somers competed on season 20 of DWTS in 2015, <a href=#>she dedicated one of her performances</a> to John. She and her partner, <strong>Tony Dovolani</strong>, recreated the Three’s Company set, and the actress wore pigtails in homage to Chrissy’s signature look.</p><p>“This one’s for you John,” she said in a pre-taped package, adding that she and her late costar had the kind of screen chemistry that only happens once in a lifetime. “It’s the dance that Chrissy and John never got to have.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKquspGju6Z50qiknqqjYr2qwMKhnJ1lkWLBqb7Enqpmm5%2BivaK62GapnpqfpMFuw8itn2aZXZ28rbvGq5imZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-really-happened-between-barbara-walters-and-her-daughter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Really Happened Between Barbara Walters And Her Daughter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gerry-house-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gerry House Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
