Since then, the DPG affiliate vowed to retaliate. Check Bad Azz’ side of the story:</p><p>“To make a long story short, I seen him with Teairra Mari last night…So I ran outside, got my uncle who was with me, who I knew was gonna squad with me, didn’t tell not one other person on Earth. He didn’t get jumped. It wasn’t nothing like that. I told my uncle that was with me, I said ‘Unc, next time I see Ray J pass me I’m taking off. Light work.’ Soon as he walked by me, I threw him a couple to the head. I respect him this one bit because he tried to fight back a little bit. But it wasn’t nothing. His homies helped him. Nobody got super mixed up. I did not knock him out cold. You know, he squabbled back, we got our little tussle on. I was cool, it was good worker morale to get your energy up on some grown man stuff. It was just to send a little message.”</p><p>Bad Azz also made a point to say that he still plans to settle the score with the other people involved in the 2005 incident. He recalled Suge attacking him with about six other men, and told the radio hosts that he is waiting for his chance at revenge. He also says Ray is romantically involved with a man named George, also known as Young Buck, a producer.</p><p>“He got a boyfriend named Young Buck and they be doing it to each other,” he said. “He flipped out and almost had a nervous breakdown, and that’s why he started messing with Whitney Houston and all these girls. Because the word on the street was he was trying to convince himself that he wasn’t homosexual.”</p><p>Check out the interview above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eupXnAs7FmnJmosLa%2F0p6qZqCZqHqntcahq2aqka56q3nBq5yao5aWwLV5wqWsm2VhaYFxg5Ro</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-dr-donald-cline-wife-leave-him-divorce-settlement-breakdown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Dr Donald Cline Wife Leave Him?
