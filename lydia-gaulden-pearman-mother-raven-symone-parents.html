Gaulden in Winnfield, Louisiana, in 1958. Her ethnicity is African-American. Lydia lived most of her life in the Louisianan town of Winnfield. She is Louise Moss’s (the late) daughter. Louise, her mother, passed away a few years ago.</p><p>She attended Winnfield High School for her education. Lydia attended Southern University after high school and graduated with a degree in computer science. She began working in the IT industry after earning her degree.</p><p>She relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, a few years after graduating. Her dream job would have been with the National Cash Register (NCR).</p><h2><span id=Lydia_was_an_IT_technician_at_work>Lydia was an IT technician at work.</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Lydia was an IT technician at work.</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Lydia Gaulden’s Relationship with Christopher Pearman, the father of Raven-Symone</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Chris and Lydia Are Happy Parents of Two Kids</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Are Christopher and Lydia Gaulden still together?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> How Much Will Lydia Be Worth in 2023?</a></li></ul><p>To advance in her IT job, Lydia relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1980s. She worked at a number of odd jobs before joining the prestigious software company National Cash Register.</p><p>several times working as a system analyst before relocating to New York City with her spouse and children. Given the success of her daughter Raven, it appears Lydia was not required to work. There is no information about the kind of employment she is performing, even whether she is employed right now.</p><h2><span id=Lydia_Gaulden8217s_Relationship_with_Christopher_Pearman_the_father_of_Raven-Symone>Lydia Gaulden’s Relationship with Christopher Pearman, the father of Raven-Symone</span></h2><p>Around the same time Gaulden relocated to Georgia, she met Christopher, the man who would become her husband. The two hit it off right away when they first met and began dating. The pair made the decision to get married later. I believe they got married in the 1980s.</p><p>Chris and Lydia were both employed in Atlanta when they first started dating. He worked as a public relations specialist for thedecidedss, and she was a system analyst. We may say that they just about made ends meet.</p><h2><span id=Chris_and_Lydia_Are_Happy_Parents_of_Two_Kids>Chris and Lydia Are Happy Parents of Two Kids</span></h2><p>The two went on to have a relationship and became parents to two amazing children, Raven and Blaize. On December 10, 1985, Raven-Symone was born in Atlanta, Georgia. Regarding her name, her mother selected Symone, while her father went with the first initial. They ultimately made the decision to retain both of them.</p><p>Raven’s parents always sensed she would become a famous person as she was growing up. She signed a contract with Ford Models at the tender age of two after moving to New York with her parents.</p><p>It’s safe to assume that her parents assisted her in making a name for herself in the entertainment industry. In oTo food on the table and allow Raven to pursue her acting career, both Lydia and Christopher put in a lot of labor.</p><p>Raven’s parents, especially her mother, were ecstatic when she was cast in the iconic Bill Cosby decided said in an interview, “Raven is a ham by nature.” She is enjoying every second of working on the project.</p><p>In order for Symone to retain every single phrase from the screenplay, her parents even read it to her about five times while she was filming the show. Lydia insisted,</p><p>“There is no sense of urgency here. She has an extraordinary memory. Me and her father are amazed by it. Furthermore, Lydia stated in the same interview that her daughter “has not a single shy bone in her body.”</p><p>To be honest, Lydia is one proud mother.</p><p>In addition, Lydia is a proud mother of Blaize Pearman, her son. He is Raven’s younger sibling. He has a somewhat reclusive existence and is not involved Fortainment industry, unlike his older sister.</p><h2><span id=Are_Christopher_and_Lydia_Gaulden_still_together>Are Christopher and Lydia Gaulden still together?</span></h2><p>Many have been inquiring as to whether starlet Raven’s parents are still together ever since she stepped away from the spotlight. This question has a very intricate answer. We discovered Lydia’s husband Christopher’s Facebook profile while conducting research. He has made it clear that he is single in the About section.</p><p>More intriguingly, Chris hasn’t shared a single photo of his wife Lydia on Facebook, which feeds into the suspicions even more. In addition, it has been a while since they both appeared together, which feeds the rumors of their split.</p><p>All we can do is guess as long as none of the parties remark on the situation.</p><h2><span id=How_Much_Will_Lydia_Be_Worth_in_2023>How Much Will Lydia Be Worth in 2023?</span></h2><p>Given that she is the mother of a highly popular actress and singer, Lydia has an opulent existence. She made a respectable salary as an IT technician as well. She hasn’t disclosed her actual net worth, though, as of yet.</p><p>However, as of 2022, her daughter Raven had a $40 million net worth.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also, Read, Jonathan Gillibrand, Faizon Love, and Manual Dallori."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":12,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":31}{"1":33,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":64}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":12,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/jonathan-gillibrand/"}{"1":31}{"1":33,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/faizon-love/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/manuel-dallori/"}{"1":64}'>Also, Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Gillibrand</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Faizon Love</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Manual Dallori</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Andrew Luteri Somerset Motorcycle Accident Linked To Death</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Mark Vito Villanella Wikipedia | Edad And Biografia</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfocaltcBmnpqtnJmyr3nPnpirpZGjeq6706Gcq2WilsOmuoyssKannpp6sa3RnqWtq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhoa-recap-claudia-jordan-flirts-with-porsha-williams-ex-husband-2015261.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RHOA Recap: Claudia Jordan Flirts With Porsha Williams' Ex-Husband!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-timberlake-once-said-he-wont-stop-singing-cry-me-a-river.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Timberlake Once Said He Wont Stop Singing 'Cry Me a River'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
