That’s my personal opinion. And it’s healthier that way. I totally believe in health and taking care of your heart and your organs and keeping this machine that we have that houses our soul healthy.”</p><p>Osmond has long been singing the praises of <a href=#>Nutrisystem</a>, which 15 years ago <a href=#>helped her shed 50 pounds</a> — and has helped her keep it off since. She even teamed up with the brand to design a weight loss program specifically designed for women ages 50 and up called Complete 50.</p><p>“At 50, we as women — our hormones go crazy,” Osmond explained. ”That middle [body] fat, that’s what ended up taking my grandmother’s and my mother’s life. And I knew genetically I was predisposed to it. So, [Complete 50] is the answer. I mean, if you want to go weigh it and cook it and measure it and do all the stressful things, but I just wanted to get the weight off. And they do it in such a great way that they give you foods that you crave. You don’t feel like you’re starving.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Marie-Osmond-Says-Weight-Loss-Drugs-Like-Ozempic-Arent-Long-Term-Effective-Inline.jpg><p>The singer admitted that she accepted her 50-pound weight gain as inevitable and “almost gave up [before] Nutrisystem.” However, everything changed when one of Osmond’s sons encouraged her to prioritize her health.</p><p>“My son came to me on behalf of all the kids. I was divorced, and they said, ‘Mom, you’re all we have,’” Osmond recalled. “That was so hard, because you know you’re overweight, and 50 pounds on me is a lot. And it was one of those knife-in-the-heart [moments] that I needed.”</p><p>Osmond emphasized that weight loss is “not about being” skinny for her; it’s about feeling her best.</p><p>“Weight ages us and it causes so many other side effects,” she told Us. “I get on the floor, I play with my <a href=#>grandkids</a>, I’m out being active, I’m living my best life. At 50, you kind of go, ‘This is who I am. Like it or lump it. I’m going to have fun.’ And to me, health is everything. I would love to have had my mother longer. I know she would’ve loved to have her mother longer.”</p><p>Osmond is the mom of eight children. She shares daughters Jessica, 36, Rachel, 34, Brianna, 27, and Abigail, 21, and sons Brandon, 27, Matthew, 24, and Michael, who <a href=#>died by suicide</a> at age 18 in 2010, with ex-husband <strong>Brian Blosil</strong>. She also shares son Stephen, 40, with husband <strong>Stephen Lyle Craig</strong>, whom she divorced in 1985 before <a href=#>remarrying him</a> in 2011.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He was always my best friend,” Osmond told Us of Craig. “He said [before we got remarried], ‘I love you, but I need to make sure that I want to love seven more children.’ … And boy, they love him. Oh, he is dad. They just adore him, and he is so good with them.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKesm670qamp5xdqK66v4yosZ6loJ6wbrXSp6tmpJ%2BjtG7AxKukZp2Wm7KkwMivnGaen6d6uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nba-finals-2016-best-memes-of-lebron-james-stephen-curry-w210617.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NBA Finals 2016: Best Memes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./makeva-jenkins-murder-where-is-euri-jenkins-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Makeva Jenkins Murder: Where is Euri Jenkins Now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
