The comedian first came up with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimeSuck</a>,&nbsp;a comedic informational podcast, where he talked about subjects chosen by his listeners including&nbsp;topics&nbsp;like serial killers, historical events, mysteries, and so on. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His new creation,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Scared To Death</a>,&nbsp;has a collab of him and his wife&nbsp;Lynze Cummins. The addition of his wife to his new venture has brought in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wider audience</a>, even more so than his previous one. With the podcaster's knack for telling ghost stories and&nbsp;Lynze's<span>&nbsp;</span>genuine and engaging reactions, the couple is scaling&nbsp;new heights.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lady Luck by His Side</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>Timesuck was Cummins' first attempt&nbsp;to share stories with his audience where he either tried to&nbsp;prove or disprove those&nbsp;accounts.&nbsp;</span>Since the first podcast was more of storytelling and fact-based series, he had the major storytelling lead, but his wife wasn't much present.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>However, with&nbsp;Scared To Death, the lovely duo has come together and created something the fans enjoy, even more so than their first series. The main idea of the series&nbsp;is clear from its name.&nbsp;In it,&nbsp;the comedian and his wife share horror stories that are meant to scare. While fans are engrossed in Cummins' storytelling abilities,&nbsp;his wife's spontaneous and hilarious reactions complement his stories well and keep them equally engaged.</span></p><p><span>Almost all of the fans from the comedian's first podcast, TimeSuck, have</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span> joined </span></a><span>in on his new venture. But in many of their videos, the couple revealed&nbsp;that&nbsp;their newly acquired fan base&nbsp;from the Scared to Death<strong>&nbsp;</strong>rarely knew about their previous one. They even addressed that their latter podcast was growing faster than their first project in its early phase.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because of their increased fanbase, the couple gave away $41,000 to 80 families who </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>needed </span></a><span>help in&nbsp;December 2020. They raised the&nbsp;amount through their Patreon pages and donations coming in from their fanbase. They additionally donated the amount matching their fan's donation.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Deets about the Power Couple</h2><p>In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a> with Stephenie James,&nbsp;the couple came along and shared the story of how they met and how their story unraveled. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They met in the year 2012 on one of the shows Cummins was doing for&nbsp;Nic<span>kolodeon, where Lynze&nbsp;coincidentally was the stylist. Lynze shared&nbsp;how annoyed she was with Cummins as he was barely cooperating. On the other hand, the podcaster shared&nbsp;how he thought she was cute.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Another coincidence was that he had mistakenly bought a pair of pants that did not belong to him.&nbsp;This then&nbsp;led her to email him about the said pants. <span>The comedian</span> shared&nbsp;that he was over the moon to hear from her and immediately asked her out following the email. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>Lynze&nbsp;further&nbsp;shared&nbsp;</span>that they clicked automatically, as they shared similar backgrounds. They knew they were a fit.</p><p>In the interview, the couple also talked&nbsp;about how the comedian's kids were a huge part of their marriage and life. He shared that he was thankful for his kids who vibed in with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mur3nCrqSmoZ6oeri1xZ6qZqifmbCiv9Nnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-cries-over-tristan-thompsons-paternity-scandal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian Cries Over Tristan Thompson's Paternity Scandal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./black-adam-reportedly-tops-vod-charts-after-disappointing-400-million-box-office.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Black Adam Reportedly Tops VOD Charts After Disappointing $400 Million Box Office</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./levi-alves-mcconaughey.html>Levi Alves McConaughey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-met-really-cool-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-game.html>Patrick Mahomes Met 'Really Cool' Taylor Swift After Chiefs Game</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sasha-czack-bio-age-now-html.html>Sasha Czack Age 68 Bio: Sylvester Stallone Net Worth, New Husband Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrey-botikov-death-and-obituary-sputnik-v-creator-strangled-with-belt.html>Andrey Botikov Death And Obituary | Sputnik V Creator Strangled With Belt</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
