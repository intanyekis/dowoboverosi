The <a href=# rel>South Carolina</a> native, 22, shared the haunting post on Facebook just a few hours before he went missing.&nbsp;</p><p>The father of one reshared a post&nbsp;from musician David Adam Byrnes that read "Them: 'Don't play any sad songs,'" followed by "Me:" along with an image of legendary country singer <a href=# rel>George Jones</a>. Doyle's post seemed to point to the fact that he would still like to prefer sad songs, especially those made iconic by Jones. Viewers and online sleuths quickly took to the comments to discuss the current scenario and whereabouts of Doyle despite the seemingly light-hearted tone of the original post.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Tina Shaw?

"It is with a heavy heart that, at this time, we are suspending the daily searches," a representative stated, adding, "Our crews are exhausted and need to return to their families and jobs."</p><p>However, Reed claimed that the search will continue as he pleaded for support from the community. He also urged his followers on TikTok to stop spreading rumors online without knowing the actual fact. "Tyler Doyle was my brother," he said, adding, "We have been out here for 10 days looking. "Everybody's searching, you know, and we're trying to figure everything out."&nbsp;</p><p>He asked to stop spreading misinformation about the incident as it is affecting the lives of him and Doyle's family.
