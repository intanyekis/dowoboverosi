But fans don't always like the design decisions that she makes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian posted a video</a> of how she did her house up for Christmas in November 2022, fans didn't agree with her decor choices, according to The New York Post. Kim said, “Look at how magical. In my bathroom, I always have plants out there, and there’s like a whole balcony and you can go through my shower [to] out there." Someone called it a "murder house" and many found it agree.</p><p>While not everyone agrees with Kim Kardashian's decor choices, she seems to love her house, which is full of neutral shades and doesn't include any bright colors.

And it's absolutely more than most would spend on all of their furniture, combined.</p><p>The Latch also mentioned that if someone wants to purchase a couch and two chairs from this company, it will cost $1 million.
